Dancing Till Dawn on the Albanian Riviera,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/travel/albania-kala-music-festival.html,"Gratitude and growing pains

Development in the Dhermi area has accelerated at a breakneck pace: Half of the adjacent village of Drymades seems to be a construction site. The influx of foreign visitors to a place that only a few decades ago was sealed off to the world has brought both prosperity and challenges.

“It’s been a 100 percent transformation,” said Erjon Shehaj, 46, whose family opened a 10-table restaurant in Dhermi in 2016. “When we started, there was nothing.” Today, they own and operate the Empire Beach Resort, a luxury hotel on the same land where the small restaurant once stood. The resort hosted the biggest stage of the festival and was booked solid all seven days.

“I’ve never encountered so many tourists in Albania,” said Anisa Koteci, 33, a lawyer, who was born in the country then emigrated with her family to London when she was 8. Returning to Albania for Kala for the first time in four years, she said, has been “a bit of a shock to the system.” The abundance of foreign visitors made her excited and happy, she said, but she also worried that Albania might become known as just a party destination. She called the wave of tourism a “stress test” for her homeland.

In Dhermi, the electricity or water was sometimes turned off at hotels without warning, and bathrooms in restaurants and bars were left uncleaned for long stretches. On the second day of the festival, one local shopkeeper wiped her brow and grumbled as she surveyed an endless line of impatient bathing-suit-clad tourists waiting to buy chips, water, beer and sunblock. She was running the grocery store and the adjacent currency exchange alone, she explained, because her brother had stayed up all night registering local SIM cards for tourists.

The flood of visitors is also raising fears about possible harm to the region’s flora and fauna. In the city of Vlore, about an hour’s drive from Dhermi, an airport construction project the government promotes as a way to bring more tourists to the Albanian Riviera has faced protests from environmental groups that say it could endanger sanctuaries for birds like flamingos and pelicans.",0.08106060606060607,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/18/multimedia/00travel-albania-02-vlkp/00travel-albania-02-vlkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['gratitude', 'pains development', 'dhermi', 'breakneck pace', 'adjacent village', 'drymades', 'construction site', 'foreign visitors', '’ s', 'percent transformation', 'erjon shehaj', '10-table restaurant', 'dhermi', 'nothing. ”', 'empire beach', 'resort', 'luxury hotel', 'small restaurant', '’ ve', 'albania', 'anisa koteci', 'london', 'albania', 'kala', 'system. ”', 'foreign visitors', 'albania', 'party destination', '“ stress test ”', 'dhermi', 'long stretches', 'local shopkeeper', 'endless line', 'impatient bathing-suit-clad tourists', 'grocery store', 'adjacent currency exchange', 'sim', 'possible harm', 'region ’ s flora', 'vlore', 'hour ’ s drive', 'dhermi', 'airport construction project', 'government promotes', 'albanian riviera', 'environmental groups', 'endanger sanctuaries']","[('Dhermi', 'LOC'), ('Half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Drymades', 'FAC'), ('only a few decades ago', 'DATE'), ('100 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Erjon Shehaj', 'PERSON'), ('46', 'DATE'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhermi', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('Today', 'DATE'), ('the Empire Beach Resort', 'GPE'), ('all seven days', 'DATE'), ('Albania', 'GPE'), ('Anisa Koteci', 'PERSON'), ('33', 'DATE'), ('London', 'GPE'), ('8', 'DATE'), ('Albania', 'GPE'), ('Kala', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('four years', 'DATE'), ('Albania', 'GPE'), ('Dhermi', 'GPE'), ('the second day of the festival', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('all night', 'TIME'), ('SIM', 'ORG'), ('Vlore', 'GPE'), ('about an hour', 'TIME'), ('Dhermi', 'GPE'), ('the Albanian Riviera', 'ORG')]",Travel
A High-Water Year for River Rafting,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/travel/white-water-rafting-rivers.html,"Midmorning on the Dolores River, you could feel how recently the water had been snow. “It’s probably about 48 degrees right now,” our guide Samy said, as she carefully angled the boat so the paddlers in front got wet and she stayed dry in the back. The white water was splashy and rolling without being scary, but it picked up speed as we headed downstream.

We were in Colorado’s Ponderosa Gorge, along the line where the Rockies slip into the red edge of the desert. Sky-scraping pines sent off a dusty cinnamon smell, and there was a shock of new green growth on the red-rock cliffs. The canyon got deeper, redder and more angular as the day went on.

"Travel 101: Our Favorite Hacks, Hints and How-Tos",https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/07/26/travel/travel-hacks-tips,"Flight delays and cancellations are unfortunate inevitabilities, especially in summer, when more people are flying and severe weather tends to occur more frequently.

How can you get your trip back on track when things go frustratingly wrong? Start by reading the fine print before booking, understanding what’s owed to you and being proactive at the airport in asking for what you want. Here’s how to do it.

Download your airline’s app, which often shows an aircraft’s location and also posts timely updates on a flight’s status or gate changes. Updates may appear here before anywhere else.

The day of your flight, you can also scan FlightAware, a flight-tracking service accessible by app and website, to get a sense of delays and cancellations across major airports. Keep an eye on the weather, too.

It can help to know what airlines your carrier partners with, in case you need to be rebooked on another airline. In addition to partnerships like code shares, when an airline operates a flight on behalf of another, or alliances, most airlines also have relationships known as interline agreements that allow them to transfer passengers to flights on other carriers.

This information isn’t always readily available online; experts suggest calling an airline’s customer service for more guidance.

Be aware that if you have a ticket with a low-cost airline, like Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines or Spirit Airlines, you are most likely out of luck: They generally do not rebook on any other carrier.

Go deeper than the dashboard

The Transportation Department’s airline cancellation and delay dashboard is a helpful resource that spells out what 10 of the larger domestic airlines offer passengers. But this dashboard is not your only tool. Customer-service plans for specific airlines (located on their websites, and with links from the D.O.T. dashboard) have further detail about passenger entitlements.

For example, if your United Airlines flight is canceled because of reasons within the carrier’s control, such as understaffing, and you are rerouted to a flight that departs the next day, you are entitled to a voucher for food, a nearby partner hotel and transportation. If a room is not available at the airline’s hotel, and you must find another accommodation, United will reimburse you for “reasonable hotel costs.” There’s nothing on the United customer-service site indicating that food receipts or taxi receipts will be reimbursed.

If a delay or cancellation is the airline’s fault, most major carriers can also rebook you on another airline. A few have this ability regardless of what led to the disruption.

In most instances, American Airlines will rebook you on another airline if there are no American flights until the next day. Delta Air Lines also commits to organizing flights on alternative airlines if necessary, though it is not clear under what circumstances it will do this.

Strategize your ask

In the United States, if your flight is canceled, for whatever reason, all airlines must either rebook you on another flight or give you a prompt refund, even if you have a nonrefundable ticket, according to the Transportation Department.

When a delay or cancellation is caused by the airline, passengers — in most cases — are entitled to a handful of services after wait times have exceeded three hours. Major carriers will provide meals or meal vouchers. And if travelers are forced to stay overnight, most airlines will cover the costs of a hotel stay and associated transport.

But getting what you’re entitled to can be a challenge when hundreds of passengers are lined up and waits for a customer service rep on the phone can stretch to hours. That’s where being strategic can make a difference.

Mary Cropper, a travel specialist at Audley Travel, advised against asking for help at the gate, where many other passengers will be, too. Instead, seek out an airline’s service desk. Airport lounges, some of which are accessible by day pass, may also be a swifter avenue to assistance, she said.

When you do reach the customer service rep, be prepared with the specific request for the outcome you want, whether it’s being rebooked on a certain flight or a flight on a partner airline, or departing from a different airport from the one you might be stranded in. Don’t just ask what your options are.

“If an alternate flight arrangement does not get you where you need to be or when you need to be there, ask for something better,” said James Ferrara, the founder of InteleTravel, a global travel adviser network. And mention if you’re a frequent flier or have an inflexible commitment like a wedding or a work conference, he added.

Just do it

Experts said passengers can also take matters into their own hands, whether that’s booking a hotel or a new flight, and submitting receipts later for reimbursement with an airline’s customer relations team. However, there is some risk that an airline won’t foot the bill, said Bobby Laurie, a travel expert and former flight attendant.

“You also have to be 100 percent sure you are in the right and are owed the reimbursement,” he said. “Armed with information, you make the best advocate for yourself. But you really, really, have to read the fine print.”

Understand that rights may differ with international flights

In the European Union, flight cancellations or long delays may give passengers the right to either a refund or a replacement flight. There may also be compensation of up to 600 euros, around $660, based on factors such as how long you waited, how much notice you were given about a schedule change, the flight’s distance, and the cause of the delay or cancellation.

The rule covers all passengers, regardless of nationality, and outbound flights from and within the European Union, including on U.S. carriers. On flights into E.U. countries, it applies only to E.U. carriers.

AirHelp, a Berlin-based flight compensation company, has a comprehensive guide outlining passenger rights in many countries.

Know you might be out of luck if the weather turns

Any compensation or help offered by the airlines hinges on whether the reason for the cancellation lies within a carrier’s control, such as staffing or maintenance issues. Air traffic control woes and the weather are not. Weather is the leading cause of delays this year to date, and “creeping delays” are the bane of every air traveler.

It may feel unfair, but “if your flight is canceled because of a thunderstorm,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com, a website that sends alerts for travel deals, “don’t expect the airline to cover your meals or accommodations.”",0.12557988182988178,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/24/travel/0724TRAVELHACK-TOP/0724TRAVELHACK-TOP-articleLarge.jpg,2023,"['flight delays', 'unfortunate inevitabilities', 'severe weather tends', 'start', 'fine print', '’ s', '’ s', 'download', 'airline ’ s app', 'aircraft ’ s location', 'timely updates', 'flight ’ s status', 'gate changes', 'updates', 'flightaware', 'service accessible', 'major airports', 'keep', 'carrier partners', 'code shares', 'interline agreements', 'information isn ’ t', 'available online', 'airline ’ s customer service', 'be', 'low-cost airline', 'frontier', 'spirit', 'transportation department ’ s airline cancellation', 'delay dashboard', 'helpful resource', 'domestic airlines', 'customer-service', 'specific airlines', 'd.o.t', 'passenger entitlements', 'carrier ’ s control', 'nearby partner hotel', 'airline ’ s hotel', 'reasonable hotel costs. ”', '’ s', 'customer-service site', 'food receipts', 'taxi receipts', 'airline ’ s fault', 'major carriers', 'ability regardless', 'american flights', 'delta', 'lines', 'alternative airlines', 'strategize', 'nonrefundable ticket', 'transportation department', 'passengers —', 'cases —', 'major carriers', 'meal vouchers', 'hotel stay', '’ re', 'customer service rep', '’ s', 'mary cropper', 'travel specialist', 'audley travel', 'airline ’ s service desk', 'airport lounges', 'day pass', 'swifter avenue', 'customer service rep', 'specific request', '’ s', 'certain flight', 'partner airline', 'different airport', 'don', '’ t', 'alternate flight arrangement', 'james ferrara', 'inteletravel', 'global travel adviser network', '’ re', 'frequent flier', 'inflexible commitment', 'work conference', 'own hands', '’ s', 'new flight', 'airline ’ s customer relations team', '’ t foot', 'bobby laurie', 'travel expert', 'flight attendant', 'fine print. ”', 'understand', 'international flights', 'european union', 'flight cancellations', 'long delays', 'replacement flight', 'flight ’ s distance', 'outbound flights', 'european union', 'u.s.', 'e.u', 'e.u', 'airhelp', 'berlin-based', 'flight compensation company', 'passenger rights', 'know', 'airlines hinges', 'carrier ’ s control', 'maintenance issues', 'air traffic control woes', 'weather', 'delays ”', 'air traveler', 'scott keyes', 'going.com', 'sends alerts', 'travel deals', '“ don ’ t']","[('summer', 'DATE'), ('The day', 'DATE'), ('FlightAware', 'PRODUCT'), ('Frontier Airlines', 'ORG'), ('Southwest Airlines', 'ORG'), ('Spirit Airlines', 'ORG'), ('The Transportation Department’s', 'ORG'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('D.O.T.', 'NORP'), ('United Airlines', 'ORG'), ('the next day', 'DATE'), ('United', 'ORG'), ('United', 'ORG'), ('American Airlines', 'ORG'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('the next day', 'DATE'), ('Delta Air Lines', 'ORG'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('the Transportation Department', 'ORG'), ('three hours', 'TIME'), ('overnight', 'TIME'), ('hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mary Cropper', 'PERSON'), ('Audley Travel', 'ORG'), ('day', 'DATE'), ('James Ferrara', 'PERSON'), ('InteleTravel', 'ORG'), ('Bobby Laurie', 'PERSON'), ('100 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the European Union', 'ORG'), ('up to 600 euros', 'MONEY'), ('660', 'MONEY'), ('the European Union', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('E.U.', 'GPE'), ('E.U.', 'ORG'), ('Berlin', 'GPE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Scott Keyes', 'PERSON'), ('Going.com', 'ORG')]",Travel
"The Wind, the Water, the Islands: Exploring Stockholm’s Archipelago",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/travel/stockholm-archipelago.html,"The moment the motor turned off, I was hooked.

It was 20 minutes into my first Swedish sailing trip on a blazingly sunny morning in late June. I’d set sail with two friends from their summer house on Kilholmen, a wooded islet in the central archipelago, about an hour by bus (then a five-minute boat ride) from Stockholm. After motoring through a narrow waterway, past smooth, rounded cliffs backed by pine forests and the occasional red timbered cottage, we entered a wide-open bay, steered the bow into the wind and raised the sails. When the puttering motor was cut, it was suddenly quiet, just the wind in my face and the sparkling archipelago all around.

The sheer magnitude of Stockholm’s archipelago is astounding. Shaped like a fan spreading out from the capital into the Baltic Sea, this watery region spans over 650 square miles — more than twice the area of New York City’s five boroughs — with somewhere between 24,000 and 30,000 islands and islets.

“The innermost islands are quite big and populated,” said Jeppe Wikström, a photographer and book publisher who has lived and worked in the archipelago for decades. “The farther out you go, the smaller the islands get, the lower they get. And in the outermost archipelago, there are only low slabs of rock.”

In Search of a Crowd-Free Summer Getaway? Try These 6 Hotels.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/travel/summer-getaways-hotels.html,"Mendoza, Argentina

While it’s summer in the United States, it’s winter in Argentina, when there are typically fewer crowds. Yet no matter the season, you’ll most likely find some tranquillity at this boutique wine hotel opened by Susana Balbo, a well-regarded winemaker (and the first woman in Argentina to graduate with a degree in oenology), along with her daughter. Located in a suburb of Mendoza, the hotel is nestled between the Andes and the city of Mendoza, and has just seven suites. The spa suites have private gardens with outdoor fire pits and heated loungers, steam rooms, “sensations showers” that allow for various combinations of water pressures and temperatures, massage tables and locally made bath products. Each suite also has a living room, a terrace and a wine fridge (some also have dry saunas). All of the suites surround a house and an outdoor pool, a setup meant to cultivate the feeling that you’re staying at a friend’s estate — only this friend has a “wellness butler” to prepare a bath of local salts and herbs in your in-suite tub, and a restaurant called La VidA that serves traditional Argentine cuisine.

There are wine tastings, of course, as well as blending classes where you can combine different varietals to create your own wine. And for those who want to taste and tour, there are “wine safaris” by seaplane to destinations like Patagonia and the Andes. Here, wine isn’t just for drinking: You can try a spa treatment like the body hydration wrap with red wine cream and raisins. Around the property, you’ll see works by Argentine and Brazilian artists. And if you want to work up a sweat, there are exercise kits with elastic bands, kettlebells, dumbbells, a yoga mat and a jump rope.

Traveling to Europe? Here’s What You Need to Know About the Heat Wave.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/travel/heat-europe-vacation-tourism-safety.html,"Southern Europe is baking, thanks to a relentless heat wave with temperatures breaking records across Italy, Spain and Greece. This extreme weather, coupled with one of the busiest tourist seasons in recent years, raises questions for travelers looking to enjoy their vacations while staying safe. Here’s what you need to know if you’re heading to Europe in the coming days, or are already there.

What areas of Europe are being hit?

Italy, Spain and Greece are the countries most impacted by a high pressure “anticyclone,” which originated in North Africa, that’s causing the record heat. Temperatures as high as 118 degrees Fahrenheit (close to 48 degrees Celsius) are possible later this week in Sicily and Sardinia; northeastern Spain saw highs of 115 degrees this week, while parts of central Greece hit 109 degrees. The hot, dry conditions have also exacerbated wildfires in Greece, Croatia, Switzerland and Spain’s Canary Islands, forcing thousands to evacuate.

How long will this heat wave last?

Forecasts show the heat wave lasting for at least another week, through the end of July. However, this particular anticyclone — named Charon, for the ferryman for the dead in Greek mythology — follows closely on the heels of another high pressure system from the Sahara.

It’s Been a Hellish Summer for the Mediterranean. And It’s Not Over.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/world/europe/italy-greece-wildfires-heat.html,"As a family sat vigil over a coffin containing the body of an elderly relative, the wooded hills around their apartment building in Palermo burned from wildfires. Winds blew the blazes closer, torching cars, dumpsters, sheds and electricity poles. Then the flames licked the apartment building, forcing its inhabitants to flee.

“We wanted to leave the house, but then the flames were behind the door,” a resident told Live Sicilia television. She said she and her family wrapped their faces in wet towels and, looking for a way out, “knocked on the door where there was the cadaver.” They all managed to escape before the coffin and the rest of the house went up in flames.

Things could hardly be worse for Italy and its Mediterranean neighbors this month. Wildfires and successive heat waves transformed their summer paradises into ghoulish hellscapes. Fires in Greece caused wartime-scale airlifts of tourists and ammunition depots to explode. Sicilian churches burned with the relics of saints inside them. And if it was not the heat, it was hail — the size of billiards in northern Italy — as the country ricocheted between weather extremes.

A Mexican Craft Brewery Where You Can Spend the Night,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/t-magazine/red-jane-bakery-chania-crete.html,"When the Hércules Textile Factory opened in the city of Querétaro in 1846, it was only the second of its kind in all of Mexico. At its peak, the factory had employed 10 percent of Querétaro’s population and occupied more than 470,000 square feet but, by 2011, when Luis Gonzalez established his craft brewery, Cervecera Hércules, in a small section of the old factory floor, the original business had atrophied, finally closing for good in 2019. Over the last 12 years, Cervecera Hércules has inhabited more and more of the old factory, building a sprawling beer garden and workshops for bakers, coffee roasters and textile designers, as well as offices for Goma, the architectural firm that took on Hércules’s most recent major transformation: the opening of its namesake hotel. Set in the abandoned mill owner’s residence — a heritage structure with graceful Palladian proportions — the 25,500-square-foot Hotel Hércules contains 40 rooms that Goma restored with the lightest possible touch, leaving brick barrel arches and chipped plaster walls intact while injecting a touch of modern glamour with midcentury furniture recovered from antique markets in Mexico City, about a three-hour drive to the southeast. Complete with a spa, two restaurants, an olive grove and a swimming pool installed in an unroofed wing of the factory, the hotel, which opened on July 20, will serve as the brewery’s guesthouse, the equivalent of the chateaus and lodges attached to vineyards around the world.

U.S. Moves to Improve Airplane Bathrooms for People With Disabilities,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/us/politics/airplane-bathrooms-disabilities-accessibility.html,"The Transportation Department announced on Wednesday that it had finalized new regulations to require more commercial aircraft to have accessible bathrooms, a long-awaited step to address complaints from disabled travelers about the difficulties of flying.

Under the regulations, new single-aisle planes with at least 125 seats will eventually be required to have at least one lavatory large enough for a disabled passenger and an attendant to enter and move around in. Twin-aisle planes are already required to have an accessible lavatory.

“Traveling can be stressful enough without worrying about being able to access a restroom,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “Yet today, millions of wheelchair users are forced to choose between dehydrating themselves before boarding a plane or avoiding air travel altogether.”

The finalized regulations came out of a lengthy effort by the Transportation Department, dating back to the Obama administration, to develop new rules intended to improve air travel for people with disabilities. In 2016, an advisory committee established by the department called for accessible bathrooms on new, larger single-aisle planes, and the department proposed new regulations last year to carry out that recommendation.",0.0835262563523433,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/multimedia/26dc-bathrooms-hwbg/26dc-bathrooms-hwbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['transportation department', 'new regulations', 'commercial aircraft', 'accessible bathrooms', 'address complaints', 'new single-aisle planes', 'twin-aisle', 'accessible lavatory', 'traveling', '” transportation secretary', 'pete buttigieg', 'wheelchair users', 'air travel altogether. ”', 'lengthy effort', 'transportation department', 'obama', 'new rules', 'air travel', 'advisory committee', 'accessible bathrooms', 'single-aisle planes', 'new regulations']","[('The Transportation Department', 'ORG'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('at least 125', 'CARDINAL'), ('at least one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Transportation', 'ORG'), ('Pete Buttigieg', 'PERSON'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Transportation Department', 'ORG'), ('Obama', 'PERSON'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('last year', 'DATE')]",Travel
Read Your Way Through Maine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/books/maine-books-lily-king.html,"Read Your Way Around the World is a series exploring the globe through books.

In American fiction, my state is code for outpost. Maine is where you send a character you want to get rid of, someone who goes off to raise goats, farm oysters, prep for the apocalypse — or write a novel. Apart from California, I can think of no other state in the Union that lives as strongly in the national collective imagination as a place to play out a festering dream.

I was in my mid-20s, waitressing on an island off the coast of Rockland, Maine, when the actor William Hurt — ultrafamous, at the height of his career — sat down in my section. I’d heard rumors that morning that he was on island, as they say, on a solo “soul-searching” sail up the coast and that his navigational equipment had broken down. He’d come to the nearest harbor for help. That was my first glimpse of the power of Maine’s particular allure. I’d grown up in Massachusetts, and no one ever searched for their soul there.

The standard fantasy is often coastal and involves fog, wet rocks and lobster boats rumbling out at dawn. Our shoreline is vast, over 3,000 miles of it, with hundreds of peninsulas and more than 4,000 islands. But Maine is not all coast. It is farms and mill towns and forests, small cities and suburbs and strip malls that look like those anywhere else in the country, except for the pointed trees off in the distance.

Some extraordinary literature has come out of this state, from all regions. Reading and writing are deeply valued up here, and we have a big, passionate literary community. Even our governor is a poet. Here are some suggestions to start with, but I barely scratch the surface with this list.",0.04130116959064326,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/books/review/26LitGuide-MAINE/26LitGuide-MAINE-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['read your', 'around', 'american fiction', 'maine', 'farm oysters', 'apocalypse —', 'california', 'national collective imagination', 'rockland', 'maine', 'william', '— ultrafamous', 'career —', '’ d', 'solo “', '” sail', 'navigational equipment', '’ d', 'maine', '’ s', 'particular allure', '’ d', 'massachusetts', 'standard fantasy', 'involves fog', 'wet rocks', 'lobster boats', 'maine', 'mill towns', 'small cities', 'strip malls', 'extraordinary literature', 'reading', 'literary community']","[('American', 'NORP'), ('Maine', 'GPE'), ('California', 'GPE'), ('my mid-20s', 'DATE'), ('Rockland', 'GPE'), ('Maine', 'GPE'), ('William Hurt', 'PERSON'), ('that morning', 'TIME'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Maine', 'GPE'), ('Massachusetts', 'GPE'), ('over 3,000 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('more than 4,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Maine', 'GPE')]",Travel
"In Milan, Giving the Aperitivo a New Twist",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/travel/in-milan-giving-the-aperitivo-a-new-twist.html,"Things are even moving forward at the old Camparino, where on any given day, behind the elegant ground-floor Bar di Passo, bartenders dressed in white jackets and black bow ties wield giant silver tweezers to ever so carefully lower citrus slices into goblets of glowing red liquid.

In 2019, a space upstairs from the main bar opened as Sala Spiritello. It is “the place where the bartenders’ art of mixology comes to life,” in the words of Tommaso Cecca, the store manager and head bartender. The most popular drink there is the Compadre, made with mezcal, chinotto liqueur, agave syrup, sweet vermouth, bitters and the inevitable Campari. And soon there will be a third smaller, invitation-only space in the basement called Sala Gaspare, named after the company founder, Gaspare Campari.

In its expanded form, the Camparino will simply be a microcosm of Milanese culture, which is always an interplay of the fresh and classical. Architectural monuments stand next to newer construction; timeless sartorial style meets current fashion on the street each day. The same extends to the drinking scene. A lot of the newer bars offer the same sort of high-concept craft cocktails you can find in other large cities, but one senses that they know they’re never going to completely win against tradition. The aperitivo will always be king in Milan.

The Solo Trip: Explore at Your Own Pace,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/travel/solo-trip-plan-tips.html,"Solo travel has the power to transform: Think of the memoirs “Eat Pray Love” or “Wild.” But you don’t have to circumnavigate the globe or hike 1,100 miles to see why some people choose to go it alone. The freedom to explore at your own pace, open to connecting with people you meet along the way, can feel as intoxicating as a tropical breeze. But solo travel can be daunting, too, especially when problems arise. And of course, solo travelers need to keep certain safety considerations in mind.

So, are you ready to plan your adventure for one? Here’s how to get the most out of it.

Start off easy

“Keep your first trip simple,” said Carolyn Ray, who runs JourneyWoman, a website for solo travelers, and has visited more than 40 countries on her own. Overcome your trepidation by picking a destination in your own country or at least where people speak your language, she advises. Also, choose accommodations with communal spaces where you can meet others and that are close to the sites you want to see.

Wield the power of one

At even the hottest restaurants, solo diners without reservations can sometimes squeeze in at the bar. And singles can often snag discounted seats at shows and performances by looking for just one ticket close to showtime, says Kat Fleischman, 36, an American public relations professional who has been taking international solo trips since she was 18. She also advises travelers to inquire about single-occupancy discounts at hotels. Travelers on their own can also hop into faster-moving singles lines at amusement parks, filling in spots left empty by groups. Universal Studios Hollywood and Six Flags Magic Mountain, near Los Angeles, and Disney World, in Orlando, Fla., all have a handful of rides with singles lines.

Join group activities

Websites like Meetup and Fun JetSetter can help break the ice with others who share your interests. An internet search can reveal an array of options: Book dinners with locals and other travelers on the website Eatwith. Find fellow nature lovers through local groups like Alaska Outdoors, in Anchorage, which organizes hikes. Find new places to enjoy your favorite activities through sites like Pickleball NSW in New South Wales, Australia. Facebook groups devoted to people living abroad, like Spain’s Expats of Málaga group, can offer local advice and people to meet.",0.2044044339498885,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/24/travel/0724TRAVELSOLO/0724TRAVELSOLO-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['solo', 'think', 'memoirs “', 'eat pray love', 'wild.', 'don ’ t', 'own pace', 'tropical breeze', 'solo travel', 'solo travelers need', 'certain safety considerations', '’ s', 'start', 'easy “', 'keep', 'carolyn ray', 'journeywoman', 'solo travelers', 'overcome', 'own country', 'communal spaces', 'wield', 'solo diners', 'kat fleischman', 'american public relations', 'international solo trips', 'advises travelers', 'single-occupancy discounts', 'singles lines', 'amusement parks', 'universal studios hollywood', 'flags magic mountain', 'los angeles', 'disney', 'orlando', 'fla.', 'singles lines', 'join', 'group activities', 'websites', 'meetup', 'fun jetsetter', 'internet search', 'book dinners', 'eatwith', 'find', 'fellow nature lovers', 'local groups', 'alaska outdoors', 'anchorage', 'organizes hikes', 'find', 'new places', 'favorite activities', 'pickleball nsw', 'wales', 'australia', 'facebook', 'spain', '’ s', 'expats', 'málaga', 'local advice']","[('Eat Pray Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Wild', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1,100 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Carolyn Ray', 'PERSON'), ('JourneyWoman', 'ORG'), ('more than 40', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Kat Fleischman', 'PERSON'), ('36', 'DATE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('18', 'DATE'), ('Universal Studios', 'ORG'), ('Hollywood', 'GPE'), ('Six', 'CARDINAL'), ('Los Angeles', 'GPE'), ('Disney World', 'ORG'), ('Orlando', 'GPE'), ('Fla.', 'GPE'), ('Eatwith', 'PERSON'), ('Alaska Outdoors', 'ORG'), ('Anchorage', 'GPE'), ('Pickleball NSW', 'ORG'), ('New South Wales', 'GPE'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('Spain', 'GPE'), ('Expats', 'NORP'), ('Málaga', 'GPE')]",Travel
Delays and Cancellations: Know Your Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/travel/flight-cancellation-delays-tips.html,"It can help to know what airlines your carrier partners with, in case you need to be rebooked on another airline. In addition to partnerships like code shares, when an airline operates a flight on behalf of another, or alliances, most airlines also have relationships known as interline agreements that allow them to transfer passengers to flights on other carriers.

This information isn’t always readily available online; experts suggest calling an airline’s customer service for more guidance.

Be aware that if you have a ticket with a low-cost airline, like Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines or Spirit Airlines, you are most likely out of luck: They generally do not rebook on any other carrier.

Go deeper than the dashboard

The Transportation Department’s airline cancellation and delay dashboard is a helpful resource that spells out what 10 of the larger domestic airlines offer passengers. But this dashboard is not your only tool. Customer-service plans for specific airlines (located on their websites, and with links from the D.O.T. dashboard) have further detail about passenger entitlements.

For example, if your United Airlines flight is canceled because of reasons within the carrier’s control, such as understaffing, and you are rerouted to a flight that departs the next day, you are entitled to a voucher for food, a nearby partner hotel and transportation. If a room is not available at the airline’s hotel, and you must find another accommodation, United will reimburse you for “reasonable hotel costs.” There’s nothing on the United customer-service site indicating that food receipts or taxi receipts will be reimbursed.",0.10416666666666667,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/31/travel/30bizsky-travel-hacks-print/24travel-hacks-rights-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['carrier partners', 'code shares', 'interline agreements', 'information isn ’ t', 'available online', 'airline ’ s customer service', 'be', 'low-cost airline', 'frontier', 'spirit', 'transportation department ’ s airline cancellation', 'delay dashboard', 'helpful resource', 'domestic airlines', 'customer-service', 'specific airlines', 'd.o.t', 'passenger entitlements', 'carrier ’ s control', 'nearby partner hotel', 'airline ’ s hotel', 'reasonable hotel costs. ”', '’ s', 'customer-service site', 'food receipts', 'taxi receipts']","[('Frontier Airlines', 'ORG'), ('Southwest Airlines', 'ORG'), ('Spirit Airlines', 'ORG'), ('The Transportation Department’s', 'ORG'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('D.O.T.', 'NORP'), ('United Airlines', 'ORG'), ('the next day', 'DATE'), ('United', 'ORG'), ('United', 'ORG')]",Travel
The Friend Trip: Fun Without the Friction,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/travel/plan-friend-trip.html,"Whoever said a friend is a friend forever has clearly never experienced a group trip that has devolved into a maelstrom of conflicting plans and bickering over restaurant bills. Traveling with your besties can be tricky. Here are some ways to do it without anyone getting unfriended.

Invite with care

“First and foremost, you cannot travel with everybody. All your friends are not travel friends,” advises N’dea Irvin-Choy, a 27-year-old Los Angeles-based travel influencer, on her popular TikTok account. She suggests picking travel partners who share similar interests, and deciding ahead of time what kind of a trip you will be taking — relaxation, partying, adventure. “The last thing you want is for your friends to be giving each other the silent treatment on a nonrefundable excursion somewhere on a beautiful tropical island,” she explained in an email.

Poll, brainstorm, then book

You can get the ball rolling by asking your friends where they want to go and what they want to do using services like Doodle, Google Forms and Troupe. Some people prefer to use familiar spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to organize the plan and share it with friends. Others prefer to use apps like Hoku, MiTravel and Plan Harmony that allow group members to collaborate in the planning process with photos, maps and more. And creating an Airbnb wish list lets friends suggest lodging options for the whole group to see. Once you’re in booking mode, Mobili provides a way to see each group member’s travel bookings at once, a tool that is especially useful for larger groups.

For sorting out flight arrangements, Robert Driscoll, who owns the L.G.B.T.Q.-focused travel agency VentureOut, swears by TripIt. After making your bookings, you can forward your confirmation emails to the app, which puts them all together on one timeline. Others in the group can then collaborate with the same trip by adding their own bookings to create a group itinerary. “It’s basically a chronological compilation of all your arrangements: flights, accommodations, car rentals, restaurants, activities, tours,” he said.",0.23823529411764705,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/24/travel/24travel-hacks-friends-illo/24travel-hacks-friends-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['whoever', 'group trip', 'restaurant bills', 'traveling', 'invite', 'care “', 'travel friends', '” advises', '’ dea', 'irvin-choy', 'los angeles-based', 'travel influencer', 'tiktok', 'travel partners', 'similar interests', '— relaxation', 'silent treatment', 'nonrefundable excursion', 'beautiful tropical island', 'poll', 'doodle', 'google forms', 'troupe', 'familiar spreadsheet programs', 'microsoft excel', 'google sheets', 'hoku', 'mitravel', 'plan harmony', 'group members', 'planning process', 'airbnb', 'list lets friends', 'whole group', '’ re', 'mobili', 'group member ’ s travel bookings', 'flight arrangements', 'robert driscoll', 'l.g.b.t.q.-focused', 'travel agency', 'ventureout', 'tripit', 'confirmation emails', 'own bookings', 'group itinerary', '’ s', 'chronological compilation', 'car rentals']","[('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Irvin-Choy', 'ORG'), ('27-year-old', 'DATE'), ('Los Angeles', 'GPE'), ('TikTok', 'ORG'), ('Doodle', 'ORG'), ('Troupe', 'ORG'), ('Microsoft Excel', 'ORG'), ('Google', 'ORG'), ('Hoku, MiTravel and', 'ORG'), ('Plan Harmony', 'ORG'), ('Robert Driscoll', 'PERSON'), ('VentureOut', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')]",Travel
"‘Attenzione, Pickpocket!’ A Voice on TikTok Warns Tourists in Italy",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/style/attenzione-pickpocket.html,"This morning, I was on the bus to Venice. From the bus, I see two men and one woman in the street. I had never seen them before. I went out from the bus and I caught them. I look at the woman and she has a bag open. There were two police, and I say, “Stop them!” They were pickpockets. In one minute, they stole wallets from three families.

Have the police ever asked you to stop?

No, never.

How do the pickpockets react? Do they ever get violent?

There was an episode about five years ago. Four girls fought me, and people stopped to see the scene. I was alone. People stopped to see the action and never helped. It was terrible. I had a neck collar for 20 days.

Did that make you want to stop?

It doesn’t matter. I will continue to do this work.

Do the pickpockets recognize you? Do they know to run away from you now?

They recognize me. The men, they affront me with the middle finger. They take pictures of me. The girls, they run away. I think they think I’m crazy, maybe?

You are famous on TikTok now.

Up in Smoke: Canada’s Outdoor Summer Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/travel/canada-wildfires-tourism-outdoors.html,"Fishing trips to Canada are a tradition for Jeffrey Hardy and his three friends from Vermont. They have, since 2001, been anglers loyal to Quebec’s northern wilderness, where the walleye are plentiful and the cellphone service is not.

This summer, the crisp forest air coveted by recreationists visiting Canada was instead polluted with smoke as wildfires have torn through millions of acres, blocking roads, destroying campgrounds and forcing tourism operators to scramble during peak season. The men’s mid-June fishing trip was canceled.

“It was a big letdown,” said Mr. Hardy, who is from St. Albans, Vt., but has been living and working remotely from Bermuda since the pandemic began. “Everybody was excited to go because Canada had been shut down for all of Covid.”

The country’s worst wildfire season on record is straining the outdoor segments of Canada’s tourism industry at a crucial time in its rebound from years of pandemic travel restrictions.

"In Remote Work Era, Hotel Operators Make a Bet on Longer Stays",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/business/extended-stay-hotels.html,"As a road warrior for 35 years, Tanna Pearman has crisscrossed the country, staying at luxury hotels and roadside motels. Her least favorite are boxy convention hotels with cavernous lobbies that are easy to get lost in. But at the top of her list is extended-stay lodging.

With guest rooms big enough for both working and unwinding, extended-stay hotels make it easy to combine business calls and sightseeing tours, said Ms. Pearman, a broker for Meetings Made Easy, a meeting planning company based in Las Vegas.

“It feels more like a living space than just a sleeping room,” she said.

Ms. Pearman has plenty of company these days. Interest in extended-stay hotels has grown, driven in part by a rise in remote work as well as an increase in work crews moving from site to site for infrastructure investments in projects like road building and green energy.

And because visitors tend to stay longer and need less housekeeping, extended-stay hotels — particularly those focused on more cost-conscious travelers — are less expensive to build and operate than their full-service counterparts.

At the time, the police asked the population in those towns to “act with the appropriate vigilance” and, if the animal was spotted, to seek shelter and alert the authorities.

In a news conference on Friday, Mayor Michael Grubert of Kleinmachnow said that the police would remain vigilant, according to Reuters.

Mr. Grubert said that an analysis of video of the animal showed that it did not have the typical features of felines, like a long, curving neck, and that shadows cast by vegetation could have made it appear differently.

The police received reports around midnight on Wednesday of a sighting of a wild animal chasing and eating a wild boar in Kleinmachnow.",0.07333333333333333,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/20/multimedia/20xp-lion-lvmk/20xp-lion-lvmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['berlin', 'stir ”', 'wild boar', 'police officers', 'small towns', 'berlin', '“ act', 'appropriate vigilance ”', 'news conference', 'michael grubert', 'kleinmachnow', 'reuters', 'mr. grubert', 'typical features', 'shadows cast', 'wild animal', 'wild boar', 'kleinmachnow']","[('20,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('about 14 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('Berlin', 'GPE'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('more than 100', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Berlin', 'GPE'), ('Friday', 'DATE'), ('Michael Grubert', 'PERSON'), ('Kleinmachnow', 'PERSON'), ('Reuters', 'ORG'), ('Grubert', 'PERSON'), ('around midnight', 'TIME'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('Kleinmachnow', 'GPE')]",Travel
Airlines Are Thriving as People Keep Traveling,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/business/airlines-profits-summer-travel.html,"But the recent recovery has been marred by problems, including delays and cancellations around the country.

Airlines and the air traffic control system have struggled to overcome bad weather, technology problems, staffing shortfalls and other disruptions over the past two years, contributing to major meltdowns like the one that Southwest Airlines suffered over several days in late December. Delays and cancellations have often cascaded on themselves, disrupting air travel for days, leaving many people stranded far from their destinations.

Weather has been responsible for nearly 70 percent of flight delays this year, compared with just under 61 percent during the same period last year, according to federal data. Heavy traffic has also contributed to delays.

United struggled to overcome a disruption before July 4, for which it had initially blamed bad weather and an air traffic control staffing shortage affecting its hub at Newark Liberty International Airport, but other airlines in the region did not struggle nearly as much. In the week leading up to the holiday weekend, the airline canceled about 17 percent of all of its flights and delayed more than 51 percent, according to FlightAware, an aviation data provider.

Overall, about 1.8 percent of planned flights were canceled in the two months that ended on Tuesday, compared with 1.9 percent over the same period in 2019, according to FlightAware data. But many more were delayed: about 25 percent over the past two months, up from about 19 percent in the same period in 2019.",0.00048076923076924614,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/20/multimedia/20airlines-qftj/20airlines-qftj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['recent recovery', 'air traffic control system', 'bad weather', 'technology problems', 'major meltdowns', 'december', 'delays', 'air travel', 'weather', 'flight delays', 'federal data', 'july', 'bad weather', 'air traffic control', 'newark liberty', 'international airport', 'holiday weekend', 'flightaware', 'aviation data provider', 'overall', 'flightaware']","[('the past two years', 'DATE'), ('Southwest Airlines', 'ORG'), ('several days', 'DATE'), ('late December', 'DATE'), ('days', 'DATE'), ('nearly 70 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('just under 61 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the same period last year', 'DATE'), ('July 4', 'DATE'), ('Newark Liberty International Airport', 'FAC'), ('the week', 'DATE'), ('up to the holiday weekend', 'DATE'), ('about 17 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('more than 51 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('FlightAware', 'ORG'), ('about 1.8 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the two months', 'DATE'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('1.9 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the same period', 'DATE'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('FlightAware', 'ORG'), ('about 25 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the past two months', 'DATE'), ('about 19 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the same period', 'DATE'), ('2019', 'DATE')]",Travel
How the Mushroom Cloud Boomed and Bloomed Across American Pop Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/movies/oppenheimer-asteroid-city-mushroom-cloud.html,"And yet something so novel and dazzling couldn’t help but make its way into popular culture. If the Bikini test could inspire the name of a swimsuit, then of course the mushroom cloud would be picked up as a titillating marketing gimmick. A few beauty queens were deployed as “Miss Atomic Bomb” and the like, wearing mushroom-shaped headgear or swimwear, part of a general fad for atomic-themed kitsch (as memorably chronicled in the documentary “The Atomic Cafe”). The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce offered calendars with detonation times for watching the mushroom clouds from desert tests. In Wes Anderson’s desert-set “Asteroid City,” characters also observe an atomic test on the horizon, trooping out of a diner to watch with nonchalance.

But a golden era of sci-fi movies in the 1950s ensured that the deadly possibilities of the atomic age were also explored in vivid visual fashion. These mushroom clouds directly addressed new sources of anxiety: the arms race (set off after the Soviets’ 1949 atomic test), the effects of radiation, and the hydrogen bomb and its even bigger boom. Monster and alien movies (and sci-fi book covers) featured the cloud as a modern Pandora’s box, a foolish unleashing of unknown forces.

From early on, it could signify the unthinkable — the erasure of civilization — as in Arch Oboler’s movie “Five” (1951), which opens with explosions and a montage of historical monuments. The cloud could represent the beginning or the end (to echo the title of a 1947 docudrama about Oppenheimer). It might be the prelude to a plot about surviving the aftermath of a nuclear blast, or the doomsday finale to a story that has gone very, very wrong. Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove,” from 1964, falls into the second category, concluding with a montage using footage from explosions (including the Trinity test).

But Kubrick alters our understanding of the mushroom clouds with the ironic usage of Vera Lynn singing “We’ll Meet Again,” originally a British World War II standard. Viewed silently, the explosions might have induced the usual dread, an emotion that in a way also fed back into awe and fear of military prowess. Kubrick’s peerless satire redirects our focus toward those in power, the absurd-sounding game-theory strategies at work, and the self-serving vanities involved — including the image of Slim Pickens riding the bomb, bronco-style, American soldier as cowboy.",0.04349529780564264,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/01/multimedia/31BOMB-ICONOGRAPHY-zpgf/31BOMB-ICONOGRAPHY-zpgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['couldn ’ t', 'popular culture', 'bikini', 'mushroom cloud', 'beauty queens', 'miss atomic bomb', 'general fad', 'documentary “', 'atomic', 'cafe ”', 'las vegas', 'detonation times', 'mushroom clouds', 'desert tests', 'wes anderson', '’ s desert-set “', 'asteroid', '” characters', 'atomic test', 'golden era', 'sci-fi movies', 'atomic age', 'vivid visual fashion', 'mushroom clouds', 'new sources', 'arms race', 'soviets', 'atomic test', 'hydrogen bomb', 'monster', 'alien movies', 'sci-fi book', 'pandora', '’ s box', 'unknown forces', 'unthinkable —', 'civilization —', 'arch oboler', '’ s movie “', 'historical monuments', 'oppenheimer', 'nuclear blast', 'doomsday finale', 'stanley kubrick', '’ s “', 'dr', 'strangelove', 'trinity', 'kubrick', 'mushroom clouds', 'ironic usage', 'vera lynn', '’ ll', 'british world war', 'ii', 'viewed', 'usual dread', 'military prowess', 'kubrick', '’ s peerless satire redirects', 'game-theory strategies', 'slim pickens', 'american soldier']","[('Miss Atomic Bomb', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Atomic Cafe', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce', 'ORG'), ('Wes Anderson', 'PERSON'), ('Asteroid City', 'LOC'), ('the 1950s', 'DATE'), ('Soviets', 'NORP'), ('’ 1949', 'DATE'), ('Pandora', 'PRODUCT'), ('Arch Oboler’s', 'FAC'), ('Five', 'CARDINAL'), ('1951', 'DATE'), ('1947', 'DATE'), ('Oppenheimer', 'ORG'), ('Stanley Kubrick', 'PERSON'), ('Strangelove', 'PERSON'), ('1964', 'DATE'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Trinity', 'ORG'), ('Kubrick', 'PERSON'), ('Vera Lynn', 'PERSON'), ('We’ll Meet Again', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('a British World War II', 'EVENT'), ('fed', 'ORG'), ('Kubrick', 'PERSON'), ('Slim Pickens', 'PERSON'), ('American', 'NORP')]",Entertainment
"The Best True Crime to Stream: Serial Killers, With Less Glorification",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/arts/true-crime-streaming-serial-killers.html,"Decades before true crime crept in from the margins and inundated pop culture, I found a humble paperback buried in the stacks of my parents’ bookshelf about America’s most notorious serial killers. Perhaps inadvisable for a 10 year old, I read and reread about the horrors inflicted by, among others, Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy. Though I was already aware that terrible things happened in general, this was different: specific, personal and intimately chilling.

Lately, and fortunately, the tired approach of centering these monsters by rehashing their personal struggles and the details of their deeds has been falling out of favor. Interest has shifted instead to elevating the stories of those impacted and to understanding the mood of the eras and the societal circumstances in which these crimes took place. This shift was reflected to some degree in July when a man was arrested in the Gilgo Beach serial killings. Profiles of the suspect abounded, but from the start, there was demand for information about the victims as well as scrutiny of the investigation.

This is the first in a series of streaming lists about true crime films, shows and podcasts. And while I won’t dwell on these types of murderers in this in the future, the topic does feel like the appropriate place to start.

Liz Kingsman Is Doing a One-Woman Show (Without Kit Harington),https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/theater/liz-kingsman-one-woman-show.html,"The pair sat down for some hummus and a doggy biscuit at a West Village restaurant near Kingsman’s rented home away from home. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Why did you move to Britain?

My mom is British, one of the “Ten Pound Poms”: They needed an immigration boost in Australia so they handed out 10-pounds tickets to British people. When it came to [university], I just went to England — I wanted to go and live in an old building and read books in a little nook somewhere. I quickly learned that it is cold and damp [laughs]. But there is a brilliant industry in London and once I started working, it was very hard to leave.

How does humor travel?

I’ve definitely found New York to be the hardest translation of the show because I think an American audience believes things that are meant to be ironic at the top. When my character says “Women’s voices aren’t getting heard in theater,” a U.K. audience knows that’s me doing a joke about a woman who would say that very sincerely onstage. But an American audience has been clapping at that line. I don’t know what to do with that because I can’t be, “No, that’s ironic!” I don’t want to generalize too much, but my experience is that there has been a tendency to sort of buy into it a little bit more here.

What makes you laugh?

I find very serious theater amusing. I saw “Sweeney Todd.” I really enjoyed it, but there’s a sort of big moment where a character dies and the next line was “Oh, no.” The actor had to deliver it with gravitas and I was like, “How are you going to do that? Somebody’s died: ‘Oh no.’ ” I just started laughing at a very serious-themed play. I can’t help it, I just find it funny.",0.12622596937113065,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/31/multimedia/31LIZ-KINGSMAN-01-tcjp/31LIZ-KINGSMAN-01-tcjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['doggy biscuit', 'village restaurant', 'kingsman', '’ s', 'britain', 'ten pound poms', 'immigration boost', 'australia', '10-pounds tickets', 'british people', '[ university ]', 'england', 'old building', 'damp [ laughs ]', 'brilliant industry', 'london', 'humor travel', '’ ve', 'york', 'hardest translation', 'american audience', '’ s voices aren ’ t', 'u.k.', '’ s', 'american audience', 'don ’ t', '’ t', '’ s ironic', 'don ’ t', 'serious theater', 'sweeney todd.', '’ s', 'big moment', 'oh', 'no. ”', 'somebody', '’ s', 'oh', 'no. ’ ”', '’ t']","[('West Village', 'GPE'), ('Kingsman', 'ORG'), ('Britain', 'GPE'), ('British', 'NORP'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('10-pounds', 'QUANTITY'), ('British', 'NORP'), ('England', 'GPE'), ('London', 'GPE'), ('New York', 'GPE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('U.K.', 'GPE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Sweeney Todd', 'WORK_OF_ART')]",Entertainment

Prince had composed the song in 1984, deciding to give it to the Family, a side project featuring the singers Susannah Melvoin and Paul Peterson. But the track never gained much recognition when the band released its self-titled album in 1985.

The response was considerably different when O’Connor, working with the Japanese jazz musician Gota Yashiki and the producer Nellee Hooper, recorded a stripped-down version for her 1990 album “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got.”

“Nothing Compares 2 U” became a No. 1 hit in 17 countries, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four straight weeks and helped win O’Connor a Grammy (which she later refused to accept).

Gardening-Adjacent Hobbies

When I first moved to Los Angeles, I planted peanuts, and I’ve been gardening ever since. My hobbies are usually garden-related, like making my own fertilizer. My kids will go get deer bones out of the woods, and then I’ll grind them up and make my own bone meal.

Grilling for Dummies

I cook pizza on my Big Green Egg, which I bought during the pandemic. I’d always been intimidated by grilling. But any moron can cook on that thing and you’ll think you’re eating at an amazing restaurant.

Thinking While on My Tractor

I’ve had a tractor for a number of years. It’s where I do most of my thinking about standup — specifically joke-writing. It lets me sit there and numb out and think about jokes I’ve done and try to add to them.

Visiting Greece and Taking It Easy

This is the thing about Greece, where my dad’s family is from, and Europe in general: It’s about walking to go get a coffee. It’s about sitting down and having a conversation. I feel like these older societies have their priorities a little bit more in check sometimes. They’ve been through it. They’ve seen it. So there’s a coolness to me about Greece. And I just agree with the lifestyle. Also, the history there is unbelievable.

‘The Simpsons’ (Made in the U.S.A.)

I’m always pleasantly surprised at how much that show can still make me gut laugh. There’s not many shows like that. Shows like “The Simpsons,” and the fact that Prince was from America, that just makes me proud to be an American.

A Book Worth Paying Attention To

When I read a book, I want everyone to know I read books, so I talk about it to everyone. “Stolen Focus,” by Johann Hari, is basically a deep, deep dive into the phone and social media.

You’ve often had the experience of being the only woman playing trombone in an ensemble. What does that feel like?

It’s lonely and isolating. If anything, I’ve been harder on myself. I’ve always felt like I had to prove myself to be there onstage. I still am really self-critical about my playing. I was stubborn in that respect, and I was also quite competitive.

If you’re in a summer program, say, or you’re in the studio and they are looking for that token female trombonist and they aren’t really accepting so many, you feel more competitive with other women.

He’s cool with being called queer, he said, explaining that it is “more freeing in a way, less about labels.”

Locke, who also identifies as queer, jumped in: “I think coming out is stupid, that it’s still a thing that people have to do.” He said he briefly came out at 12 on Instagram before reconsidering.

Emmy Awards Will Be Postponed Because of Actors’ and Writers’ Strikes,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/media/emmy-awards-postponed-strikes.html,"The fallout from the Hollywood actors’ and writers’ strikes continues.

Emmy organizers are hopeful that would give the Hollywood studios enough time to settle the labor disputes. A new date will be finalized in the next few weeks.

"Paul Reubens, Creator of Pee-wee Herman, Is Dead at 70",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/arts/paul-reubens-pee-wee-herman-dead.html,"Paul Reubens, the comic actor whose childlike alter-ego Pee-wee Herman became a movie and television sensation in the 1980s, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 70.

His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was confirmed on Monday by his longtime representative Kelly Bush Novak, who said he had “privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.”

“Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years,” Mr. Reubens said in a statement released with the announcement of his death, The Associated Press reported. “I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.”

Mr. Reubens had scores of acting credits in a career that began in the 1960s, including roles on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Murphy Brown,” “The Blacklist” and many other television series and in movies like “Batman Returns” (1992) and “Blow” (2001).",0.21500000000000002,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/31/multimedia/31xp-reubens-tbjq/31xp-reubens-tbjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['paul reubens', 'comic actor', 'childlike alter-ego', 'pee-wee herman', 'television sensation', 'los angeles', 'cedars-sinai', 'medical center', 'longtime representative', 'kelly bush novak', 'trademark tenacity', 'wit. ” “', 'please', '’ ve', 'mr. reubens', 'huge amount', 'you. ”', 'mr. reubens', 'buffy', 'vampire slayer', '” “', 'murphy brown', '” “', 'blacklist', 'television series', 'batman returns', 'blow']","[('Paul Reubens', 'PERSON'), ('the 1980s', 'DATE'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('Los Angeles', 'GPE'), ('70', 'DATE'), ('Cedars-Sinai Medical Center', 'ORG'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Kelly Bush', 'PERSON'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('the last six years', 'DATE'), ('Reubens', 'PERSON'), ('The Associated Press', 'ORG'), ('Reubens', 'PERSON'), ('the 1960s', 'DATE'), ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Murphy Brown', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Blacklist', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Batman Returns', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1992', 'DATE'), ('2001', 'DATE')]",Entertainment
"To Keep TV Shows Afloat, Some Networks Are Cutting Actors’ Pay",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/business/media/actors-strike-bob-hearts-abishola-pay.html,"Starring on the CBS sitcom “Bob Hearts Abishola” has been good for Bayo Akinfemi. Being a regular cast member for four years has given him financial security and made him a star in his native Nigeria, where the show is wildly popular. It even helped him branch out from acting, when producers gave him the opportunity to direct an episode.

But Mr. Akinfemi and 10 of his castmates were told this year that the only way the half-hour show was going to get a fifth season was if budgets were cut. How the actors were paid was going to change.

No longer would they be guaranteed pay for all 22 episodes of a season. Instead, Mr. Akinfemi and his castmates would be reclassified as recurring cast members. They would be paid the same amount per episode, but unlike regular cast members, they would be paid only for the episodes in which they appeared and would be guaranteed only five of those in a truncated 13-episode season, once the actors’ strike was over and performers returned to work. (Only Billy Gardell, who plays the white middle-aged businessman Bob, and Folake Olowofoyeku, who plays Abishola, the Nigerian nurse he loves, will remain series regulars.)

"Obsessed with the Ocean, Susan Casey Takes the Plunge",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/books/susan-casey-book-ocean-the-underworld.html,"Her deep sea adventures were exhilarating, and occasionally harrowing.

On a dive, Casey and Vescovo plunged more than 5,000 meters to explore the ecosystem at the base of an underwater volcano in Hawaii, where they saw carpets of neon orange microbes and navigated a maze of lava formations. During a trip to the bottom in the Bahamas, Casey panicked briefly when the submersible’s pilot noticed water around their feet, and tasted it to determine if the water was fresh, from condensation, or salty, from a leak. It was fresh, and they continued exploring, flying over dunes of snow white silt.

In a phone interview from her landlocked home in the Hudson Valley, Casey spoke about the most awe-inspiring life form on the planet, how the recent tragic accident involving the OceanGate submersible could impact deep sea expeditions, and why deep sea mining poses an unfathomable threat to the planet. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Given how massive and important it is, why do you think we’ve paid so little attention to the deep ocean?

For the longest time, there was this sense of, it’s this barren, lifeless place. It’s dark. The pressures are pretty insane as you get deeper. How could anything live there?

It took a really long time for people to understand that there is life throughout the entire water column.

What’s on TV This Week: ‘Run the Burbs’ and ‘The Trial’,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/arts/television/whats-on-tv-this-week-run-the-burbs-and-the-trial.html,"Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, July 31 — Aug. 6. Details and times are subject to change.

Monday

RUN THE BURBS 8:30 p.m. on the CW. Is it redundant to have a set of those cute family-member bumper stickers on the back of a blue Toyota minivan, that icon of suburban soccer-practice shuttling? Is that not a bit like sticking a “baby on board” sign to the handlebars of an infant’s carriage? Don’t tell that to the Phams, the family at the center of “Run the Burbs,” who have a set on their shiny van. A Canadian sitcom cocreated by Andrew Phung (a star of “Kim’s Convenience”) and Scott Townend, the program follows the Phams — a mother, Camille (Rakhee Morzaria), and father, Andrew (Phung), and their two children (played by Zoriah Wong and Roman Pesino) — as they navigate contemporary suburban life. The debut episode, which airs Monday, is built around preparations for a neighborhood block party.

BREEDERS 10 p.m. on FX. The yin to the “Run the Burbs” yang, this dark and bold British comedy was encapsulated by a line that Paul, a father played by Martin Freeman, said to Ally (Daisy Haggard), his wife, in the very first episode: “I would die for those kids, but often I also want to kill them.” Since its debut in 2020, the show has mined humor from the least glamorous sides of family life. Major themes of its fourth and final season, which picks up five years after the previous season and is set to debut Monday night, include divorce, aging and teen pregnancy. In a 2020 interview with The New York Times, Freeman (who is also a creator of the series) explained that the show was interested in giving a frank look at less-discussed parts of parenting. “In nice sort of lefty, liberal circles,” he said, “you don’t really talk about how you want to throw your kids out of the [expletive] window.”

Tuesday

ICONIC AMERICA: OUR SYMBOLS AND STORIES WITH DAVID RUBENSTEIN 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This documentary series, hosted by the philanthropist David Rubenstein, has been loose with what constitutes an “iconic” part of America’s identity: Previous episodes have been dedicated to the history of both physical sites (including the Statue of Liberty and the Hollywood sign) and shared imagery (cowboys, bald eagles).

"SunRay Kelley, Master Builder of the Counterculture, Dies at 71",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/arts/sunray-kelley-dead.html,"His buildings had undulating peaked roofs, or roofs shaped liked wings or the prow of a ship. They were often planted with sedum, moss and trailing nasturtiums (green roofs are naturally cooling). He loved cupolas and turrets. His preferred shape was the circle, which he felt was nature’s most resilient form; hence the preponderance of yurts in his oeuvre. He was a master of cob, a sturdy, thermally efficient sculptural material made from mud, sand and straw that has been used around the world for millenniums.

Other favored building materials were scavenged and used as they were — unmilled windfall trees, gnarled branches, rocks and boulders. “God’s hardware store,” Mr. Kelley called the woods of the Pacific Northwest, where many of his buildings were made. “I’m going shopping,” he would say in the middle of construction, striding off into the wilderness.

He made some 70 structures, mostly in North America but with a smattering in Central America as well.

The real showplace for his eclectic work and methods, however, was his own property, nine acres in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in a former mill town in Washington State that had been in his family for three generations, a homestead otherwise known as SunRay shire, or simply the shire.

There one will find the soaring, shingled “Sky House” and the funky “Earth House,” his first effort, with cast bronze hands that support the roof beams; a hermit hut built on the massive stump of an old growth tree; numerous ponds and waterfalls; and a collection of yurts large and small, including one sparkly pink number fashioned from cob flecked with mica and festooned with the sculpted forms of the female body; an enormous anatomically accurate representation serves as its doorway. This particular yurt was designed for yoga practice; Mr. Kelley called it the Yogurt.

The compound has for decades drawn alternative-building pilgrims, whom Mr. Kelley would often cajole into work duty.

They started to dig.

Rome is the gift that keeps on giving to archaeologists, though no one knew what would come from this preliminary exploration, a familiar routine at Italian building sites and development projects.

To the archaeologists’ surprise — and immense delight — the dig brought to light traces of a first-century theater that the team believes was built by Nero, the emperor with a now disputed reputation for tyranny, debauchery and a desire to indulge his inner artist. Although chronicled by Roman-era historians, the theater had never emerged from Rome’s archaeologically rich underbelly.

‘Tom Lake’ Finds Ann Patchett in a Chekhovian Mood,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/books/review/ann-patchett-tom-lake.html,"Are you in possession of a hammock? A creaky old porch swing?

Patchett’s actual family of origin was complicated, as she made explicit after the 2016 publication of the semi-autobiographical “Commonwealth.” “The Dutch House” (2019), which had a wicked stepmother, did not stray far from the idea that living with relatives can be messy and hellish.

A Vanishing Masterpiece in the Georgia Marshes,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/arts/design/beverly-buchanan-land-art-georgia.html,"Buchanan trained as a scientist. She came to New York City for graduate studies, earning master’s degrees in parasitology and public health from Columbia University in the late 1960s, then worked as a health educator in the Bronx and New Jersey. But she also made and began showing abstract paintings, encouraged by Norman Lewis and Romare Bearden.

Her turn to sculpture began in New York. She used found bricks as molds for casting concrete and pulverized rocks to make pigments. She called the works “frustulas,” from a Latin word meaning fragments. She was fascinated by decay, regeneration and how, as she wrote in 1978, “piles of rubble can be pulled together to form new systems.”

She showed a “Wall Column” made of four cast cement sections in “Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States,” at A.I.R. Gallery — a landmark 1980 show that challenged prevailing conceptions of feminist art. The artists Ana Mendieta, who helped organize the show, and Howardena Pindell, whom it also featured, were among her friends.

By then, however, she had resettled in small-town Georgia — first Macon, then Athens — beginning a fade from view in the New York scene that was later compounded by ill health. But the South held her heart and concerns, and in Georgia her sculpture added scales, materials and methods, in tune with the land and its stories.

“It’s certainly the biggest concert we’ve had in a while,” said Mouse Reusch, a seismologist at the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, which monitors earthquake activity in the Pacific Northwest. “We’re talking about 70,000 people and all the music and paraphernalia associated with the concert.”

The so-called “Swift Quake” recorded a maximum ground acceleration of roughly 0.011 meters per second squared, said Jackie Caplan-Auerbach, a seismologist at Western Washington University.

Seismologists use acceleration to measure ground vibrations, which are then converted to the more conventional Richter scale, the common measurement for earthquakes.",-0.02202380952380953,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28xp-swift-quake-03/28xp-swift-quake-03-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['taylor swift', 'taylor swift', 'seattle', 'weekend shook', 'nearby seismometer', '’ s', '’ ve', 'reusch', 'seismic network', 'monitors earthquake activity', '’ re', 'concert. ”', 'so-called “', 'swift quake', 'maximum ground acceleration', 'jackie caplan-auerbach', 'washington', 'seismologists', 'ground vibrations', 'richter', 'common measurement']","[('Taylor Swift', 'PERSON'), ('Taylor', 'PERSON'), ('Seattle', 'GPE'), ('last weekend', 'DATE'), ('2.3', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mouse Reusch', 'PERSON'), ('the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network', 'ORG'), ('the Pacific Northwest', 'LOC'), ('about 70,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Swift Quake', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('roughly 0.011 meters', 'QUANTITY'), ('Jackie Caplan-Auerbach', 'PERSON'), ('Western Washington University', 'ORG')]",Entertainment
"Mari Ruti, Scholar of Gender, Sexuality and More, Dies at 59",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/books/mari-ruti-dead.html,"Mari Ruti, who in wide-ranging writings on gender and sexuality found food for thought not only in psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan but also in online pornography, self-help books and a Julia Roberts movie, died on June 8 at a hospital near her home in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia. She was 59.

Heather Jessup, a friend, said the cause was complications of cancer.

Dr. Ruti, a longtime professor at the University of Toronto, was known for tackling, both in the classroom and in more than a dozen books, subjects like how to lead a meaningful life and the effects of rigid gender roles.

“Bringing together psychoanalysis, feminism and queer theory, Mari focused on the fissures in society and considered how we might most authentically respond to them,” Hilary Neroni, a professor at the University of Vermont and Dr. Ruti’s literary executor, said by email. “For her, this meant not trying to cover them over but rather working to engage them.”

She did that in books like “Feminist Film Theory and ‘Pretty Woman’” (2016), in which she took a fresh look at the 1990 movie starring Ms. Roberts as a beautiful prostitute and Richard Gere as the businessman who falls for her, and at other romantic comedies — a genre that is often derided by critics as fluff yet has proved popular among women. “Pretty Women,” she concluded, was more complex than it seemed.",0.2453125,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/31/multimedia/28Ruti1-gptl/28Ruti1-gptl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['mari ruti', 'wide-ranging writings', 'sigmund freud', 'jacques lacan', 'online pornography', 'self-help books', 'julia roberts', 'june', 'mahone', 'nova scotia', 'heather jessup', 'ruti', 'longtime professor', 'toronto', 'dozen books', 'meaningful life', 'rigid gender roles', 'bringing', 'queer theory', 'mari', 'hilary neroni', 'vermont', 'ruti', '’ s', 'literary executor', 'them. ”', 'feminist film theory', 'woman', '’ ”', 'fresh look', 'ms. roberts', 'beautiful prostitute', 'richard gere', 'romantic comedies —']","[('Mari Ruti', 'PERSON'), ('Sigmund Freud', 'PERSON'), ('Jacques Lacan', 'PERSON'), ('Julia Roberts', 'PERSON'), ('June 8', 'DATE'), ('Mahone Bay', 'GPE'), ('Nova Scotia', 'GPE'), ('59', 'DATE'), ('Heather Jessup', 'PERSON'), ('Ruti', 'PERSON'), ('the University of Toronto', 'ORG'), ('more than a dozen', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mari', 'PERSON'), ('Hilary Neroni', 'PERSON'), ('the University of Vermont', 'ORG'), ('Ruti', 'PERSON'), ('Feminist Film Theory and ‘Pretty Woman’', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('1990', 'DATE'), ('Roberts', 'PERSON'), ('Richard Gere', 'PERSON'), ('Pretty Women', 'WORK_OF_ART')]",Entertainment
Review: This ‘Summer Stock’ Cast Is Having a Blast,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/theater/summer-stock-review.html,"At this point we have been burned by many musical adaptations of beloved movies, and reactions have ranged from “Why did they even bother?” to “Dear God, please make it stop.” So it was with some trepidation that I traveled to the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut to check out its take on Charles Walters’s “Summer Stock,” from 1950.

The movie’s plot in shorthand: Gene Kelly and Judy Garland put on a show in a barn, and then she sings “Get Happy” at the end. Naturally, that last exhortation pops up in the world-premiere stage version (twice, even) currently running in East Haddam, but it is easy to take to heart: The show may not be perfect, but its craftsmanship, zest and good humor — which are deceivingly hard to achieve without falling into bland cheerleading and forced joy — are perfectly dosed and on target.

The book writer Cheri Steinkellner stuck to the movie’s spirit rather than its letter, though she wisely did not mess with the central conceit: A group of theater kids led by the director Joe Ross (Corbin Bleu, last seen on Broadway in the 2019 revival of “Kiss Me, Kate”) find themselves rehearsing a musical on the struggling farm of one Jane Falbury (Danielle Wade).

A notable change is that in the director-choreographer Donna Feore’s production, the local businessman and Jane’s sort-of antagonist, Jasper Wingate, has become the stern Mrs. Wingate (Veanne Cox, in supreme form), who wants to take over our heroine’s land to create “the largest commercial farming operation in the Connecticut River Valley.” The Wingate heir is still an oaf named Orville (Will Roland, from “Be More Chill”), but this time around he has a secret — no, not that one. When Jane must find money to save her farm, Joe suggests using his show for a benefit.",0.2639423076923077,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/31/multimedia/28summer-stock-lztj/28summer-stock-lztj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['musical adaptations', 'dear god', 'stop. ”', 'goodspeed', 'opera house', 'connecticut', 'charles walters', '’ s “ summer stock', 'movie ’ s plot', 'gene kelly', 'judy garland', 'sings “', 'happy', 'world-premiere stage version', 'haddam', 'good humor —', 'joy —', 'book writer', 'cheri steinkellner', 'movie ’ s spirit', 'central conceit', 'theater kids', 'joe ross', 'corbin bleu', 'broadway', 'kiss', 'kate', 'jane falbury', 'danielle wade', 'donna feore', '’ s production', 'local businessman', 'jane', '’ s sort-of antagonist', 'jasper wingate', 'mrs. wingate', 'veanne cox', 'supreme form', 'heroine ’ s land', 'connecticut', 'valley.', 'wingate', 'orville', 'will roland', 'be', 'chill', 'secret —', 'jane', 'joe']","[('Dear God', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the Goodspeed Opera House', 'ORG'), ('Connecticut', 'GPE'), ('Charles Walters’s', 'PERSON'), ('Summer Stock', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1950', 'DATE'), ('Gene Kelly', 'PERSON'), ('Judy Garland', 'PERSON'), ('Get Happy', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('East Haddam', 'GPE'), ('Cheri Steinkellner', 'PERSON'), ('Joe Ross', 'PERSON'), ('Corbin Bleu', 'ORG'), ('Broadway', 'FAC'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('Kiss Me, Kate', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Jane Falbury', 'PERSON'), ('Danielle Wade', 'PERSON'), ('Donna Feore', 'PERSON'), ('Jane', 'PERSON'), ('Jasper Wingate', 'PERSON'), ('Wingate', 'PERSON'), ('Veanne Cox', 'PERSON'), ('the Connecticut River Valley', 'LOC'), ('Wingate', 'PERSON'), ('Orville', 'PERSON'), ('Be More Chill', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Jane', 'PERSON'), ('Joe', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
Jason Aldean’s Culture War Hit,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/arts/music/popcast-jason-aldean-small-town.html,"When the country superstar Jason Aldean released his new single “Try That in a Small Town,” it was met largely with a shrug, and didn’t seem likely to become one of his signature hits. But when the song’s video was released, full of footage (actual news and stock) of disruptive crowds, criminal activity and anti-police sentiment — and a scene filmed at a site known for the 1927 lynching of an 18-year-old Black man — the song suddenly became a culture war flashpoint.

Out of nowhere, it hit No. 2 in the country, on the strength of support in right-wing circles. Its success has opened up the usual wounds in the country music business about its lack of inclusivity, and publicly pitted some of its biggest names against each other.

On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about how the idea of the small town has been weaponized in country music; Nashville’s tug of war between social progressives in the industry and right-wing audiences; and how culture war content plays out commercially, on radio and in sales.

Guests:

Marcus K. Dowling, who reports on country music for The Tennessean

Amanda Marie Martinez, a historian and postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has written extensively about race and country music

"50 Rappers, 50 Stories: Hear the Remix",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-50-rappers-playlist.html,"Dear listeners,

Last week, the Times published a sprawling interactive package called 50 Rappers, 50 Stories, celebrating the upcoming 50th anniversary of hip-hop.* The day it ran, I set aside about 10 minutes to start browsing during lunch; the next thing I knew, more than an hour and a half had passed. It’s one of those kinds of projects.

My colleagues spoke with — you guessed it — 50 different rappers about their careers and relationships with hip-hop, and the result is a mosaic of varied voices and narratives that run parallel and intersect in unexpected ways (like the Cash Money poet Lil Wayne and the New York provocateur Azealia Banks both identifying as theater kids). LL Cool J talks about meeting Paul Simon for the first time (“I’m gonna be honest with you, I didn’t even know who Paul Simon was, bro”); 50 Cent takes style inspiration from Juvenile (“Get me some baby oil!”); Cardi B cites the precise moment she traded in Barney the Dinosaur for Missy Elliott. Trust me, it’s all a delight.

My fellow pop music critic Jon Caramanica and culture reporter Joe Coscarelli helmed the editorial end of this ambitious project and did many of the interviews themselves. They also created a comprehensive, roughly chronological 50-track playlist featuring all the artists they chatted with, and I can’t recommend that enough.

But I thought it would be fun to have them put together a separate one for The Amplifier, featuring some deep cuts and personal favorites. The result is a playlist encompassing a variety of eras and regions, featuring plenty of marquee names (Cam’ron, Outkast) alongside entries from some of the more outré corners of hip-hop (Lil B, Trippie Redd).

Five International Movies to Stream Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/movies/international-movies-streaming.html,"‘Everybody Loves Jeanne’

Stream it on Mubi.

Anyone with an overactive inner critic will feel seen and heard by this bittersweet debut feature from the illustrator and filmmaker Céline Devaux, which charts a middle-aged Frenchwoman’s coming to terms with grief and professional failure. As Jeanne (Blanche Gardin) deals with the aftermath of her mother’s suicide and the televised collapse of her own invention to rid the ocean of microplastics, Devaux imagines her protagonist’s anxiety as an animated figure that nags her constantly, voicing Jeanne’s worst thoughts about herself. This nifty conceit is one of the many inspired quirks that imbue “Everybody Loves Jeanne” with wit and charm, without undercutting its more serious themes.

With brisk editing and bright colors, the film unfolds as a tale of whimsy. Jeanne travels to Lisbon to clear out her mother’s apartment and sell it to save herself from bankruptcy. On the way, she runs into Jean (Laurent Lafitte), a goofy kleptomaniac who claims to know her from her school days. As Jeanne confronts difficult memories (and even ghostly hallucinations) of her mother and exasperating encounters with her ex, her path keeps crossing with that of Jean, whose kooky exterior slowly chips away to reveal his own battles with mental health. Brimming with warmth and hope, “Everybody Loves Jeanne” is a light-as-air tale about the heaviest of themes: the grown-up struggle to love oneself.

"Jean Fagan Yellin, Who Uncovered a Slavery Tale’s True Author, Dies at 92",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/books/jean-fagan-yellin-dead.html,"Jean Fagan Yellin, a historian whose six years of sleuthing revealed that what had been presumed to be a 19th-century white author’s fictional account of a young woman’s life as a slave in the American South was, in fact, a rare autobiography written by a formerly enslaved woman, died on July 19 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 92.

Her death was confirmed by her son, Michael Yellin.

The author’s name was Harriet Jacobs.

“There are only a couple of names that are commonly known of 19th-century women held in slavery — Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman,” Dr. Yellin said during a lecture at Harvard University in 2004, when she published a book about her findings, “Harriet Jacobs: A Life.”

“Both could not write, because enslaved people were subject to anti-literacy laws,” Dr. Yellin added. “Their stories, in their own pens, do not exist. Jacobs is it.”

Originally published in 1861, Harriet Jacobs’s book, “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” vividly recounted her enslavement from her birth in North Carolina in 1813.

The Dance Delight in ‘Barbie’ Belongs to the Kens,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/arts/dance/ken-dance-barbie-movie.html,"There’s a gorgeous scene in “Barbie” that isn’t painted the usual pink. It isn’t dripping in plastic or sequins. It’s a dream ballet, stylish and clean, with steps so sleek it lets bodies — Kens, Kens and more Kens — sing.

Unofficially known as the Ken dance, it’s like entering a portal to another world, where moving bodies etch trails of rotating circles and diamonds onto a gleaming surface. It transports you back to the time of Busby Berkeley, when elegant dancers swirled in and out of kaleidoscopic formations.

But the jazzy gist of the “I’m Just Ken” dance isn’t just about staggering patterns or nostalgia for old Hollywood. Plopped into Greta Gerwig’s Barbie universe, the dance is more than a dance: It’s an emotional release. With five leading Kens in front and a sweeping chorus of dancers shuttling behind and around them, the choreography is a passionate expression of selfhood, a tonic that recalls the vitality and athletic grace of Gene Kelly.

It’s odd: In the first half of the film, Margot Robbie, as the lead, Stereotypical Barbie, operates from a body that is restrained — she’s clunky. This makes sense. She lacks joints! But as the film progresses, an everyday movement vocabulary takes over. Barbie glides into a modern, pedestrian body while the men, wooden at first, learn to move expansively.

Big Hair and Big Thoughts at a Paris Museum,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/arts/design/hair-paris.html,"The exhibition, called “Des cheveux et des poils” in French, which means something like “Hair and Fur,” runs through Sept. 17 and takes up both floors of the museum’s main gallery space. It is billed as delving into “the hairy history of hair from the 15th century to the present day,” with over 600 objects and art works gathered from museums around the world, exploring the evolution of women’s hairstyles, the question of removing facial and body hair for men and women, hairpieces, hair dye, razors, hair dryers, cultural attitudes to baldness, “the pixie and sauerkraut of the 1960s” and the “hurluberlu” of the mid-17th century. Hair, hair, hair.

When first entering the space — through a doorway printed with a close-up of a rugby player’s rampant chest hair from a 1912 painting by Eugène Pascau — the prospect of so much hair-themed material ahead seems something of a chore. How long can thoughts of hair occupy the attention, really? How interesting can 600-plus hair-related objects actually be?

Yet hair — and what we think it says about ourselves and others — turns out to be one of the interesting subjects in the world, and 600 objects isn’t nearly enough. An exhibition about hair is also an exhibition about self-presentation and self-perception, difference and hierarchy, race, religion, control, disgust, childhood, adulthood, masculinity and femininity.

Take Louis Leopold Boilly’s “Portrait of Madame Fouler” (1810), in the first room of the show. A young woman with an arrestingly chic haircut — cropped, curly and imminently due a revival, if anyone is looking for an image to show their hairdresser — looks off to one side with a halfhearted smile. The accompanying label explains that the seemingly anachronistic shortness of Madame Fouler’s style, known as the “Titus,” had its origins in the “bals des victimes,” dances that were held during the French Revolution for the relatives of people whose life was cut short by the guillotine. There is a description from a contemporary witness, who recounts that some of the balls required that attendees “cut their hair short around the neck, just as the executioner cuts the hair of victims.” A haircut is an announcement, as Madame Fouler knew.",0.1218253968253968,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28hair-notebook-kqfv/28hair-notebook-kqfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['des', 'des poils ”', 'french', 'hair', '” runs', 'sept.', 'museum ’ s', 'main gallery space', 'hairy history', 'present day', 'women ’ s hairstyles', 'body hair', 'hair dye', 'hair dryers', 'cultural attitudes', '1960s ”', '“ hurluberlu ”', 'mid-17th century', 'hair', 'space —', 'rugby player ’ s rampant chest hair', 'eugène pascau', 'hair occupy', 'hair —', 'others —', 'interesting subjects', 'objects isn ’ t', 'louis leopold boilly', '’ s “', 'portrait', 'madame fouler', 'young woman', 'chic haircut —', 'hairdresser —', 'anachronistic shortness', 'madame fouler', '’ s style', 'titus', '“ bals des victimes', '” dances', 'revolution', 'attendees “', 'executioner cuts', 'victims. ”', 'madame fouler']","[('Des cheveux', 'PERSON'), ('French', 'NORP'), ('Hair and Fur', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Sept. 17', 'DATE'), ('the 15th century', 'DATE'), ('the present day', 'DATE'), ('600', 'CARDINAL'), ('the 1960s', 'DATE'), ('the mid-17th century', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('1912', 'DATE'), ('Eugène Pascau', 'PERSON'), ('600', 'CARDINAL'), ('600', 'CARDINAL'), ('Louis Leopold Boilly', 'PERSON'), ('Portrait of Madame', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Fouler', 'PERSON'), ('1810', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Fouler', 'PERSON'), ('Titus', 'PRODUCT'), ('the French Revolution', 'EVENT'), ('Fouler', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment

And is there a Morris style, as there are Graham and Cunningham and Taylor styles? Yes, Morris said: “Everything in my work derives from music. I don’t want 180-degree turnout, which, even if it were possible, just leads to injury. But I do want intimate and constant connection to music.”

A Morris classroom also becomes — as ballet at its best has been since the Italian Renaissance — a society, in which musicality, alignment, courtesy and mutual awareness are prime virtues. Humanity, too: Morris, an invariably entertaining talker, speaks exuberantly to his dancers, between exercises — about what’s on television, about an unmissable Broadway show (and about the long lines for the ladies room in Broadway theaters), about New York traffic gridlock, about Olive Oyl. But this spiel isn’t just a one-way Morris event: He wants his dancers to be people with lives and interests, not just dance executants, and he enjoys their repartee.

While teaching, Morris walks around the room, giving advice and corrections. Aaron Loux, who performed with the group until 2022, said in a video interview from Seattle. “I felt that for each dancer he would have a different set of objectives he wanted them to develop.” (For Loux, the biggest challenge was his hands, he said. “Mark was pointing out a blind spot.”)

Sam Black, who became a full-time Morris dancer in 2005 and is now the company director sharing the teaching assignments, will give his stage farewell during the Joyce season. In an interview at the Mark Morris Dance Center in Brooklyn in July, he recalled how he used to stretch his arms too straight upward in certain positions. Morris would say, “You only have three joints in your arm. You have to make a curve with only three joints. That takes imagination.”",0.08444135229849514,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/multimedia/30morris-teacher-kfzc/30morris-teacher-kfzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['morris', 'technique ”', 'way people', 'cecchetti', 'vaganova', 'balanchine', 'morris', '“ yes', 'ballet teachers', 'music. ”', 'morris', 'graham', 'cunningham', 'taylor', 'morris', 'don ’ t', '180-degree turnout', 'constant connection', 'music. ”', 'morris', 'italian renaissance —', 'mutual awareness', 'prime virtues', 'humanity', 'morris', 'exercises —', '’ s', 'broadway', 'long lines', 'ladies room', 'broadway', 'york', 'traffic gridlock', 'olive oyl', 'spiel isn ’ t', 'morris', 'dance executants', 'morris', 'aaron loux', 'video interview', 'seattle', 'different set', 'develop. ”', 'loux', 'mark', 'blind spot. ”', 'sam black', 'morris', 'company director', 'teaching assignments', 'stage farewell', 'joyce', 'mark morris dance', 'brooklyn', 'july', 'certain positions', 'morris']","[('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Cecchetti', 'PERSON'), ('Vaganova', 'PERSON'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Graham', 'PERSON'), ('Cunningham', 'PERSON'), ('Taylor', 'PERSON'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('180', 'CARDINAL'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('the Italian Renaissance', 'ORG'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Broadway', 'FAC'), ('Broadway', 'FAC'), ('New York', 'GPE'), ('Olive', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('Aaron Loux', 'PERSON'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('Seattle', 'GPE'), ('Loux', 'ORG'), ('Mark', 'PERSON'), ('Sam Black', 'PERSON'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('2005', 'DATE'), ('Joyce', 'PERSON'), ('the Mark Morris Dance Center', 'ORG'), ('Brooklyn', 'GPE'), ('July', 'DATE'), ('Morris', 'PERSON'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('only three', 'CARDINAL')]",Entertainment
"72 Regional Theaters, One Shared Crisis",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/insider/regional-theater-crisis.html,"How do you balance the demands of daily news reporting with bigger-picture projects?

I’m probably going to be doing fewer features about individual shows, while I focus on more of these stories about the health of the field, but I still want to write occasional pieces about artists and works of art. I think a mix of stories is what keeps a reporter sane.

Do you anticipate doing a lot of that reporting in person?

I hope so. A couple of days ago, I went to see “Evita” at American Repertory Theater outside of Boston, and over the weekend I went to see a play called “tiny father” at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires. On Thursday, I saw a production of “Fun Home” at the Studio Theater in Washington, D.C. I’m trying, to the extent I can, to see things outside New York. We need to pay more attention to nonprofit theaters and theaters outside New York — because there are real challenges in those places we need to be telling our readers about.

What was the most surprising thing you learned while reporting this article?

I was struck by how many theaters are now doing coproductions. It’s pretty dramatic: The Shakespeare Theater Company in D.C. had one coproduction out of six shows before the pandemic, and now at least five out of six will be coproductions this coming season. There’s also a lot of experimentation with collaboration, which is heartening. Theaters that once saw themselves either as competitors or just strangers are much more interested in finding ways to help one another.

Your article touches on a number of potential solutions. Which seem most promising?

There’s a coalition forming of theaters in Connecticut that is talking about whether the theaters might be able to share set-building functions. Those kinds of approaches might have promise. A lot of theaters are talking about the possibility of either more government assistance or for more foundations to take seriously the challenges facing this field. There’s a shared sense that box-office revenue, which has never been enough to sustain these organizations, is not going to be a primary part of the solution.

How will we see an effect on Broadway, which depends on nonprofit theaters to develop material and support artists?

The situation means less work for artists, actors, writers, directors and designers. Fewer shows are being staged, and those shows are often smaller and have shorter runs, which is a challenge both for the people who are already established in the field and the people who are seeking to enter it. There’s just less work to go around.",0.16684491978609628,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28a2_insider-03-wbpz/28a2_insider-03-wbpz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['daily news', 'bigger-picture projects', '’ m', 'individual shows', 'occasional pieces', 'reporter sane', 'evita', 'american repertory theater', 'boston', 'tiny father ”', 'barrington', 'stage company', 'berkshires', 'fun', 'home ”', 'studio theater', 'washington', 'd.c.', '’ m', 'york', 'nonprofit theaters', 'york', 'surprising thing', '’ s', 'shakespeare', 'theater company', 'd.c.', '’ s', 'theaters', 'just strangers', 'your', 'article touches', 'potential solutions', '’ s', 'connecticut', 'government assistance', '’ s', 'box-office revenue', 'primary part', 'broadway', 'nonprofit theaters', 'support artists', 'fewer', 'shorter runs', '’ s']","[('daily', 'DATE'), ('A couple of days ago', 'DATE'), ('Evita', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('American Repertory Theater', 'ORG'), ('Boston', 'GPE'), ('the weekend', 'DATE'), ('Barrington Stage Company', 'ORG'), ('Berkshires', 'GPE'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('Fun Home', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the Studio Theater', 'FAC'), ('Washington', 'GPE'), ('D.C.', 'GPE'), ('New York', 'GPE'), ('New York', 'GPE'), ('The Shakespeare Theater Company', 'ORG'), ('D.C.', 'GPE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('six', 'CARDINAL'), ('at least five', 'CARDINAL'), ('six', 'CARDINAL'), ('this coming season', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Connecticut', 'GPE'), ('Broadway', 'FAC')]",Entertainment

He was 77.

The cause was complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the band said on its website.

“Randy was an integral part of the Eagles and instrumental in the early success of the band,” the group said.

“God, he had the most beautiful voice,” the singer Vince Gill, who joined the Eagles in 2017, said in a recent interview with The Los Angeles Times.

‘Oppenheimer’ Fans Are Rediscovering a 40-Year-Old Documentary,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/day-after-trinity-oppenheimer-documentary.html,"One morning in the 1950s, Jon H. Else’s father pointed toward Nevada from their home in Sacramento. “There was this orange glow that suddenly rose up in the sky, and then shrank back down,” Else recalled.

It was, hundreds of miles away, an atomic weapon test: a symbol of the world that was created when a team of Americans led by the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer exploded the first nuclear bomb a decade earlier on July 16, 1945.

Growing up in the nuclear age left an impression on Else, now 78.

He was later a series producer of the award-winning “Eyes on the Prize,” a program on the civil rights movement, and directed documentaries about the Great Depression and Wagner’s “Ring” cycle. But before all that, in 1981, he made a documentary about Oppenheimer, the scientist whose bony visage graced the covers of midcentury magazines, and the bomb. It was called “The Day After Trinity,” a reference to that inaugural detonation.

Decades later, viewers are flocking to Else’s film, a nominee for the Academy Award for best documentary feature, as a companion to Christopher Nolan’s biopic “Oppenheimer,” which grossed more than $100 million domestically in its opening week this month.",0.23034188034188036,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/arts/27oppenheimer-documentary/27oppenheimer-documentary-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2023,"['jon h. else', '’ s father', 'nevada', 'sacramento', 'orange glow', 'else', 'atomic weapon test', 'j. robert oppenheimer', 'nuclear bomb', 'july', 'growing', 'nuclear age', 'else', 'series producer', 'eyes', 'civil rights movement', 'depression', 'wagner', '’ s “', 'ring', '” cycle', 'oppenheimer', 'bony visage', 'midcentury magazines', 'trinity', 'inaugural detonation', 'decades', 'else', '’ s film', 'academy award', 'christopher nolan', '’ s biopic “', 'oppenheimer']","[('One morning', 'TIME'), ('the 1950s', 'DATE'), ('Jon H.

A Less Anxious Edvard Munch,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/arts/design/edvard-munch-clark-art-institute.html,"The exhibition of the work of the Norwegian painter and printmaker Edvard Munch at the Clark Art Institute here is fun. Serious fun. High fun, if you will. But fun nonetheless. The thrilling kind that comes from seeing a major modern painter in a new, broader, enlivening light. This is the achievement of the Clark’s sumptuous, revisionary “Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth.”

The artist gleaned from the 47 paintings and almost as many prints in this exhibition is not just the godfather of figurative Expressionism — despite the show’s rather hammy title. Nor is he the neurotic, alcoholic painter of “The Scream” of 1893 — a revolutionary artwork and by now, a fixture of popular culture. And he is not the Munch who has typically been seen as an ingenious, innovative printmaker, but who lost his edge as a painter and went into decline after he recovered from a nervous breakdown.

It had come in 1908 after Munch had spent 15 years establishing his career in Berlin. He checked himself into a clinic in Copenhagen for several months after which he returned to Norway, leading a supposedly reclusive existence for the remaining three and a half decades of his life. (Even though he traveled almost as much around Europe as before.) This attitude has led to an embarrassing dearth of Munch paintings in American museums — rarely more than one, if any — but never mind.

This show, the first of its kind in the United States, takes a fresh approach by concentrating on Munch’s use of landscape — both as primary subject and as background — and the role of nature as the visual, emotional and philosophical wellspring for his work. And without much fuss, it gives equal space to Munch early and late, reducing their differences with a new sense of consistency based, oddly, on restlessness itself. Munch refused to stay put; his constant motion can bring to mind that of the great peripatetic postwar German artist Sigmar Polke.",0.16536255411255413,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/27/multimedia/27munch-clark-review8-qjth/27munch-clark-review8-qjth-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['norwegian', 'edvard munch', 'clark art', 'serious', 'high fun', 'fun nonetheless', 'thrilling kind', 'major modern painter', 'clark', '’ s', 'revisionary “', 'edvard munch', 'trembling earth.', 'expressionism', 'show ’ s', 'hammy title', 'alcoholic painter', 'scream', 'revolutionary artwork', 'popular culture', 'munch', 'innovative printmaker', 'nervous breakdown', 'munch', 'berlin', 'copenhagen', 'norway', 'reclusive existence', 'europe', 'munch', 'american museums —', 'fresh approach', 'munch', '’ s', 'landscape —', 'primary subject', 'background —', 'equal space', 'munch', 'new sense', 'munch', 'constant motion', 'great peripatetic postwar', 'german artist', 'sigmar polke']","[('Norwegian', 'NORP'), ('Edvard Munch', 'PERSON'), ('the Clark Art Institute', 'ORG'), ('Clark', 'PERSON'), ('Edvard Munch', 'PERSON'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('47', 'CARDINAL'), ('The Scream', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1893', 'DATE'), ('Munch', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1908', 'DATE'), ('Munch', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('15 years', 'DATE'), ('Berlin', 'GPE'), ('Copenhagen', 'GPE'), ('several months', 'DATE'), ('Norway', 'GPE'), ('three and a half decades', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Munch', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('more than one', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('Munch', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Munch', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Munch', 'ORG'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Sigmar Polke', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment

He was 68.

His wife, Barbara (Pratt) Geddie, said the death was heart-related.

“The View” was Ms. Walters’s idea — she wanted a program on which women from different generations would discuss the issues of the day — but it was Mr. Geddie who oversaw it for 17 years, ushering the changing, sometimes unruly cast of panelists through a daily hour of hot topics, disagreements and personal revelations.

“I think he loved doing a show with all women,” Meredith Vieira, who was the moderator of “The View” for nine years from its start in 1997, said in a phone interview. “He was a strong producer who deferred to the female point of view, which was essential for a man running a women’s show.”

‘War Pony’ Review: The Sad Absurdities of Reservation Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/war-pony-review.html,"The Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Lakota-Sioux, has one of the highest poverty rates and shortest life expectancies in the United States. Over 80 percent of adults are unemployed. “War Pony,” a stellar debut from Riley Keough and Gina Gammell, written in collaboration with two of its residents, Franklin Sioux Bob and Bill Reddy, has every right to be a furious tragedy.

Instead, it’s a slacker comedy that swaps punchlines for laid-back, lived-in absurdities. The jokes land so feather-light you’re not sure if you should laugh. Likewise, the characters barely register the film’s larger social criticisms — they just take their lumps and get on with things. As Sioux Bob told The Associated Press shortly before “War Pony” won the Caméra d’Or at Cannes, “All this outlandish stuff you see in the movie, that was Tuesday.”

The story follows 23-year-old Bill (Jojo Bapteise Whiting), who has fathered two toddlers with two women, one of whom he has left languishing in jail for lack of a $400 bail. “I don’t have time for this,” Bill huffs.

His daughter Julia Barry said he had died overnight in his sleep. He had been receiving medical treatment for congestive heart failure and, in recent weeks, for late-stage kidney disease.

Like Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, Mr. Bruce died young (he was 40) and became a figure of continually renewed pop-culture lore. His comedy career and his criminal prosecutions on drug and obscenity charges inspired museum exhibitions, one-man theatrical performances and biographies. From 2017 until this year, a fictionalized version of Mr. Bruce was a recurring character on the Amazon Prime television show “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”",-0.044166666666666646,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/obituaries/00Barry-Julian1-print1/00Barry-Julian1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['julian barry', 'broadway', 'hollywood', 'lenny bruce', 'lenny', 'definitive portraits', 'truth teller', 'righteous struggle', 'american hypocrisy', 'beverly', 'calif', 'julia barry', 'medical treatment', 'congestive heart failure', 'recent weeks', 'late-stage kidney disease', 'marilyn monroe', 'john lennon', 'mr. bruce', 'pop-culture lore', 'comedy career', 'criminal prosecutions', 'obscenity charges', 'museum exhibitions', 'theatrical performances', 'mr. bruce', 'amazon prime', 'television show “', 'marvelous mrs. maisel']","[('Julian Barry', 'PERSON'), ('Broadway', 'FAC'), ('Hollywood', 'GPE'), ('Lenny Bruce', 'PERSON'), ('Lenny', 'PERSON'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('morning', 'TIME'), ('Beverly Hills', 'GPE'), ('Calif.', 'GPE'), ('92', 'DATE'), ('Julia Barry', 'PERSON'), ('overnight', 'TIME'), ('recent weeks', 'DATE'), ('Marilyn Monroe', 'PERSON'), ('John Lennon', 'PERSON'), ('Bruce', 'PERSON'), ('40', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Bruce', 'PERSON'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('The Marvelous', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Maisel', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
‘The Unknown Country’ Review: A Granddaughter’s Road Trip,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/the-unknown-country-review.html,"Shangreaux, her husband, Devin, and their daughter, Jasmine, are among the performers here portraying themselves. In the film’s most inventive, gently disruptive gesture, the nonprofessional cast members’ actual stories are recounted in their voice-overs. Think of these mini-documentary profiles — of a waitress (Pam Richter), a gas station attendant (Dale Leander Toller), a motor lodge owner (Scott Stampe), and the nonagenarian Florence R. Perrin, a two-stepping mainstay at the Western Kountry Klub in Midlothian, Texas, as rest stops in Tana’s trip.

Gladstone, who stars in Martin Scorsese’s upcoming “Killers of the Flower Moon,” delivers a performance that is hushed and anchoring. But the film’s gentle detours into the real-life stories remind us that it is the people met on the road that so often make the trip memorable.

‘Kokomo City’ Review: Dispatches From the Down Low,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/kokomo-city-review.html,"The documentary “Kokomo City” features interviews with people who aren’t often given the chance to publicly share their life stories. The film follows four Black transgender women, who speak directly to the camera about how they got into sex work and what they learned about human nature once they got there.

The film’s vivacious interviews take place in personal, bare settings, as the film’s subjects put on makeup and get dressed. One by one, the interviewees — Daniella Carter, Koko Da Doll, Liyah Mitchell and Dominique Silver — share candid stories of how they sustain themselves in a profession whose clients can quickly turn toward violence.

In a tragic reminder of the film’s life-or-death stakes, one of the documentary subjects, Koko Da Doll, was fatally shot in April, just months after the film’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.

The season — the company’s 65th — runs from Nov. 29 to Dec. 31, and is dedicated to the women of Ailey, including a program on Dec. 19 that pays tribute to the choreographers and dance educators who helped shaped the organization: Carmen de Lavallade, Judith Jamison, Denise Jefferson and Sylvia Waters.

“It’s really about honoring the strength and vision and guidance of these strong women who have made it possible for us to still be here,” said Robert Battle, the company’s artistic director.

While few details have been released about the death, the police said that it was not being treated as suspicious.

Ms. O’Connor, best known for her rendition of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U,” was 56.

Her family confirmed Ms. O’Connor’s death in a short statement. “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinead,” the statement said. “Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time.”

Ms. O’Connor recently moved to London, according to local news media outlets. On Thursday afternoon, the city’s police force said in a statement that officers pronounced Ms. O’Connor dead at the scene at a residential address in southeast London. “A file will be prepared for the coroner,” the statement added.

"At Soho Rep, Eric Ting and Caleb Hammons to Join Leadership Team",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/theater/soho-rep-eric-ting-caleb-hammons.html,"Eric Ting and Caleb Hammons will join Cynthia Flowers as the next directors of Soho Rep, the Lower Manhattan theater announced on Thursday.

They will replace Sarah Benson and Meropi Peponides, who had directed the Off Off Broadway company with Cynthia Flowers since 2019 under its shared leadership model. (Both women, who departed in June, have said they wanted to focus more on their own creative output.)

“The spirit of the theater centers risk and experimentation,” said Ting, 50, who made his New York City directorial debut with the Jackie Sibblies Drury play “We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Südwestafrika, Between the Years 1884-1915” at Soho Rep in 2012 before becoming the artistic director at the East Bay theater company Cal Shakes, a position he held until 2022. “There’s a boldness to the work and a kind of artistic rigor that I’ve never found anywhere else.”

The size of the organization — with a 65-seat theater that has long been a home for experimental, formally inventive work — was part of the appeal for Hammons, who comes to the theater from the Fisher Center at Bard, an incubator for commercially promising new work in the Hudson Valley. (He has been the director of artistic planning and producing since 2020, after joining the organization as senior producer in 2013.)",0.2686363636363637,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/arts/27SOHO-REP-ITEM/27SOHO-REP-ITEM-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['eric ting', 'caleb hammons', 'cynthia', 'soho rep', 'lower manhattan', 'sarah benson', 'meropi peponides', 'off off broadway', 'cynthia', 'leadership model', 'june', 'own creative output', 'theater centers risk', 'ting', 'york', 'city directorial debut', 'jackie sibblies drury', 'proud', 'present', 'presentation', 'herero', 'namibia', 'formerly known', 'africa', 'südwestafrika', 'years', 'soho rep', 'artistic director', 'bay theater company', 'cal shakes', '’ s', 'artistic rigor', '’ ve', 'else. ”', 'organization —', '65-seat theater', 'inventive work —', 'hammons', 'fisher', 'bard', 'promising new work', 'hudson', 'senior producer']","[('Eric Ting', 'PERSON'), ('Caleb Hammons', 'PERSON'), ('Cynthia Flowers', 'PERSON'), ('Soho Rep', 'ORG'), ('Lower Manhattan', 'GPE'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('Sarah Benson', 'PERSON'), ('Meropi Peponides', 'PERSON'), ('Cynthia Flowers', 'PERSON'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('Ting', 'PERSON'), ('50', 'DATE'), ('New York City', 'GPE'), ('the Jackie Sibblies Drury', 'ORG'), ('We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Southwest Africa', 'GPE'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Years 1884-1915', 'DATE'), ('Soho Rep', 'ORG'), ('2012', 'DATE'), ('East Bay', 'LOC'), ('Cal Shakes', 'PERSON'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('65', 'CARDINAL'), ('Hammons', 'PERSON'), ('the Fisher Center', 'FAC'), ('Bard', 'ORG'), ('the Hudson Valley', 'LOC'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('2013', 'DATE')]",Entertainment
‘How To With John Wilson’ Loves All of You Weirdos,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/arts/television/how-to-with-john-wilson-season-3.html,"Sometimes a toilet is more than just a toilet.

The final season premiere of the docu-essay series “How To With John Wilson” opens, like many of its episodes, with a problem. Wilson, whose self-help ruminations began airing on HBO in 2020, has a home plumbing emergency that sends him on a search for New York City’s elusive public bathrooms.

But the episode, “How to Find a Public Restroom,” is about more than the lengths New Yorkers will go to for relief. Wilson visits the Hole (a neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border where many homes are too far below sea level to connect to the sewer system) and also interviews a doctor who injects the wealthy with Botox to address “Hamptons bladder” (the agony of holding it in on a long ride to the beach).

It goes on. Wilson talks to cabdrivers who resort to peeing in empty water bottles for lack of accessible facilities. He gets scolded by police for filming at the Vessel, the Ozymandian monument to upscale real-estate development at Hudson Yards. Eventually, he befriends a woman whose trailer has a functioning loo and hitches a ride with her to Burning Man.

You think I am giving away the entire episode. There is much more. Wilson builds out his story like a complex system of plumbing. And as you wend your way through the U-bends and elbow pipes, it becomes a rich, scattershot-but-purposeful reflection on class, privatization, vulnerability, the public commons and — you’ll have to trust me on this one — apocalypse preparation.",0.17171717171717174,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/arts/27how-to/27how-to-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['final season premiere', 'docu-essay series “', 'john wilson', 'wilson', 'self-help ruminations', 'hbo', 'york', 'city ’ s elusive', 'public bathrooms', 'find', 'restroom', 'yorkers', 'wilson', 'hole', 'brooklyn-queens', 'sea level', 'sewer system', 'botox', 'address “', 'hamptons', 'bladder ”', 'wilson', 'empty water bottles', 'accessible facilities', 'vessel', 'ozymandian', 'upscale real-estate development', 'hudson', 'eventually', 'burning', 'entire episode', 'wilson', 'complex system', 'u-bends', 'elbow pipes', 'scattershot-but-purposeful reflection', 'public commons', '’ ll', '— apocalypse preparation']","[('“How To With', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('John Wilson', 'PERSON'), ('Wilson', 'PERSON'), ('HBO', 'ORG'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('New York City’s', 'GPE'), ('How to Find a Public Restroom', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('New Yorkers', 'NORP'), ('Wilson', 'PERSON'), ('Brooklyn', 'GPE'), ('Botox', 'ORG'), ('Wilson', 'PERSON'), ('Hudson Yards', 'FAC'), ('Burning Man', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Wilson', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
Review: Young Bros and Maidens Harmonize in ‘Love’s Labor’s Lost’,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/theater/loves-labors-lost-review.html,"“Let’s rock!” is something I’m pretty sure no character in Shakespeare ever said. But on a sandy stage under a jaunty tent, with a green hillside as a welcoming backdrop, it seemed an apt way to begin “Love’s Labor’s Lost.”

It is, after all, a young man’s play, both in its authorship (Shakespeare was about 30) and story (four callow bros fall madly in love with four sharp maidens). And this production, directed by Amanda Dehnert for the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, intensifies the youth-crush factor with 10 emo songs. Neither fully true to the strange original nor completely remade as a viable musical, it swings between those poles in ways that are both tiresome and charming.

Let’s start with the charming: The catchy songs, by Dehnert and the Chicago-based composer André Pluess, tap the sappy heart of summer and are danceable to boot. (You may be the audience member asked at one point to prove it.) Whether folky or funky, and despite lyrics that sound little like Shakespeare — “she’s a nice girl, always thinking twice girl” — they match the story emotionally, with titles like “The Infinite Ones” (as youth always sees itself) and “Change to Black” (as youth at some point must do).

That the songs don’t match the story structurally is probably an insuperable problem. “Love’s Labor’s Lost,” with or without the British “u,” is a very youthful, disjointed text, its thin thread of plot repeatedly cut by clowns, dullards, puns, pomposities and noodling that goes nowhere. Misdelivered letters and absurd disguises contribute. By the time you get to the masque near the end, featuring impenetrable spoofs of the nine classical “worthies,” you may doubt young Shakespeare’s judgment of worthiness.",0.1533045977011494,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/27LOVES-1-wjkz/27LOVES-1-wjkz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['’ s rock', '’ m', 'shakespeare', 'sandy stage', 'jaunty tent', 'green hillside', 'apt way', 'love', '’ s labor ’ s', 'lost.', 'young man ’ s', 'shakespeare', 'callow bros fall', 'sharp maidens', 'amanda dehnert', 'hudson', 'shakespeare', 'youth-crush factor', 'emo songs', '’ s', 'catchy songs', 'dehnert', 'chicago-based', 'andré pluess', 'sappy heart', 'audience member', 'whether', 'shakespeare', '— “', '’ s', 'nice girl', 'girl ” —', 'infinite ones', 'black', 'songs don ’ t', 'insuperable problem', 'love', '’ s labor ’ s', 'lost', 'british “ u', 'thin thread', 'misdelivered', 'absurd disguises contribute', 'impenetrable spoofs', 'classical “ worthies', 'shakespeare', '’ s judgment']","[('Shakespeare', 'PERSON'), ('Love’s Labor’s Lost', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Shakespeare', 'PERSON'), ('about 30', 'CARDINAL'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('bros fall', 'ORG'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('Amanda Dehnert', 'PERSON'), ('the Hudson Valley', 'LOC'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dehnert', 'PERSON'), ('Chicago', 'GPE'), ('André Pluess', 'PERSON'), ('summer', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Shakespeare', 'PERSON'), ('The Infinite Ones', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Change to Black', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Love’s Labor’s Lost', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('British', 'NORP'), ('pomposities', 'ORG'), ('nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('Shakespeare', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
A Trumpeter Stretches Past the Bounds of Jazz,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/arts/music/chief-xian-atunde-adjuah-bark-out-thunder-roar-out-lightning-review.html,"Growing up in New Orleans, Chief Xian aTunde Adjuah was raised at the corner of two traditions. He learned to play the trumpet at the elbow of his uncle and mentor, the saxophonist Donald Harrison Jr., whose career took off after a stint in Art Blakey’s band. Harrison was a true-blue jazz musician, and Adjuah — who was born, and first introduced to the listening public as, Christian Scott — seemed destined to become one, too.

But their family was also prominent in New Orleans’s tradition of Black masking Indians, rooted in the city’s history of Black and Indigenous resistance in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Africans fleeing slavery often joined with Native Americans in maroon communities. While professional musicians laid down the roots of American jazz in the late 1800s — mixing African styles with European repertoire at parades and society functions — groups of so-called Mardi Gras Indians dressed in bright regalia performed songs with a more unbroken connection to West and Central Africa, and little relationship to a commercial audience. To this day, Black masking Indians sing those old songs on Mardi Gras Day.

Adjuah now carries that history. He has become a big chief of a Black Indian group, the Xodokan Nation, just as his uncle and grandfather were before him. On July 1, in a ceremony at historic Congo Square, the Ashé Cultural Arts Center named Adjuah the Grand Griot of New Orleans.

Adjuah has worked for years to convince the world that he’s not a “jazz” musician at all: The word’s racist history is now widely acknowledged; he says “stretch music” is a more appropriate catchall for the alloy of African influences, Black American improvisation, hip-hop, indie rock and more that he has been polishing for the past two decades. But it has always been tough to hear the music he makes with his bands, and not think immediately about where it fits in the cosmology of (what most of us know as) contemporary jazz.",0.07526199494949495,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/multimedia/27adjuah-review-jkfc/27adjuah-review-jkfc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['growing', 'orleans', 'xian', 'adjuah', 'donald harrison jr.', 'art blakey', '’ s band', 'harrison', 'true-blue jazz musician', 'adjuah', 'scott', 'orleans', '’ s tradition', 'black', 'city ’ s history', 'black', 'indigenous', 'africans', 'native', 'maroon communities', 'professional musicians', 'american jazz', 'late 1800s —', 'african', 'european repertoire', 'society functions — groups', 'mardi gras', 'bright regalia', 'unbroken connection', 'africa', 'commercial audience', 'black', 'old songs', 'mardi gras', 'adjuah', 'black', 'indian group', 'xodokan nation', 'july', 'congo', 'ashé cultural', 'adjuah', 'griot', 'orleans', 'adjuah', '’ s', '“ jazz ” musician', 'word ’ s racist history', 'music ”', 'appropriate catchall', 'african influences', 'black', 'american improvisation', 'indie rock', 'contemporary jazz']","[('New Orleans', 'GPE'), ('Adjuah', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Donald Harrison Jr.', 'PERSON'), ('Art Blakey’s', 'PERSON'), ('Harrison', 'PERSON'), ('Adjuah', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Christian Scott', 'PERSON'), ('New Orleans', 'GPE'), ('Indians', 'NORP'), ('Black', 'LOC'), ('the 18th and 19th centuries', 'DATE'), ('Africans', 'NORP'), ('Native Americans', 'NORP'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('the late 1800s', 'DATE'), ('African', 'NORP'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Mardi Gras', 'EVENT'), ('Indians', 'NORP'), ('West', 'LOC'), ('Central Africa', 'GPE'), ('this day', 'DATE'), ('Indians', 'NORP'), ('Mardi Gras Day', 'EVENT'), ('Adjuah', 'PERSON'), ('Black Indian', 'NORP'), ('the Xodokan Nation', 'ORG'), ('July 1', 'DATE'), ('Congo Square', 'FAC'), ('the Ashé Cultural Arts Center', 'ORG'), ('Adjuah the Grand Griot', 'ORG'), ('New Orleans', 'GPE'), ('Adjuah', 'PERSON'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('African', 'NORP'), ('Black American', 'NORP'), ('the past two decades', 'DATE')]",Entertainment
The Life and Death of a ‘Punk Rock Warhol’,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/style/the-life-and-death-of-a-punk-rock-warhol.html,"“Kozik was a punk rock Warhol,” said the artist Shepard Fairey. “He was all about subverting culture. But whereas Warhol was hanging out with the Rolling Stones and the beautiful people, Frank was listening to Black Sabbath and chain-smoking and not making friends. Even his most famous character, Labbit, it might look cute, but it’s about subverting culture. Kozik saw his work as a Trojan Horse to grab people’s attention before reminding them that all is not perfect in paradise.”

“He wasn’t good at sucking up to the establishment,” Mr. Fairey continued. “The artists who enter art history are frequently the people sucking up to the people who write art history. I’d like that my work be remembered, so I’m willing to play the game to a degree, but Kozik didn’t have patience for that. To hear he’s now been unsung, I think, is something he’d have fun being bitter about.”

As Mr. Kozik told it in interviews, his penchant for defiance could be traced to his youth.

Born in 1962, he was raised in Madrid during Francisco Franco’s dictatorial regime. His father was an American serviceman, his mother a Spanish aristocrat. After they divorced, he grew up with his mother’s family, which he once described as a “weird, wealthy, super-old-fashioned household of fascists.” When he visited his father in California, he was tantalized by American pop culture, so he moved to live with him when he was a teenager.

In the suburbs of Sacramento, Mr. Kozik embraced the slackerish counterculture of the 1970s, holing up in his bedroom listening to Pink Floyd while reading comics like Heavy Metal. After a falling out with his father, who struggled with alcoholism, he dropped out of high school and fled his home.

The artist’s Hudson Valley studio is working on a multimedia installation and performances that will open in April 2024 and be titled “the space in which to place me,” referring to a poem by Layli Long Soldier, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation.

When the Dutchman Mondrian arrived in New York in 1940, fleeing first the Nazi occupation of Paris and then the London Blitz, his reputation as one of Europe’s most celebrated artists preceded him. At Tate Modern, a diorama of his studio on East 59th Street from that period shows the stark white two-room apartment covered in configurations of primary-colored cardboard rectangles, like test studies for his geometric paintings.

A neighboring model offers a different kind of architecture for the cohabitation of art and life: “The Temple,” envisioned by the Swedish artist and mystic Hilma af Klint. An impenetrable ten-sided monolith, the never-realized structure was to be made of alabaster, with an astronomical tower and a spiraling internal staircase.

A Guide to Art Exhibitions in New York and Massachusetts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/arts/design/weekend-art-exhibitions-outside-nyc.html,"This summer, the centerpiece within the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known as Mass MoCA, is not a painting or a giant metal sculpture, but a pink roller coaster designed by the artist EJ Hill. The installation has been on view since the fall, inviting audiences to hop inside the single-rider cart and whiz through a curvy 260-foot track. Merging delight with terror, the roller coaster is a metaphor; the artist wanted participants to experience the same lows and highs that he experiences as a queer Black man in the U.S.

“I feel like I understand bodily threat in a very real way,” Hill told The Times in a recent interview. “Every day when I leave my place the threat to my bodily existence is palpable.”

The artist is known for performances that have tested his endurance and emotions, including a 2018 installation for an exhibition at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles where he stood silent for three days on a podium overlooking turf and a fabricated racetrack — a sendup of the hypervisibility and stress that some people of color feel in elite institutions.

"‘El Agua’ Review: After the Flood, the Legends",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/el-agua-review.html,"In “El Agua,” aquatic myths ensnare the teenage dreams of 17-year-old Ana (Luna Pamies). In a series of documentary interviews interspersed throughout the film, locals relate the myth of the women who have water “inside them,” who disappear whenever a flood arrives. Then there is the curse that supposedly afflicts Ana, her mother (Nieve de Medina) and her grandmother (Bárbara Lennie), three fiercely independent women who live together. Ana yearns to leave the stifling village and finds hope in the mysterious José (Alberto Olmo), who claims to have returned to the village after a trip abroad.

The movie weaves together several threads, of which Ana’s coming-of-age is the weakest: Her adolescent rebellions and her fling with José play out rather predictably, never quite evoking the lust or portent that the film’s folklore suggests. But “El Agua” succeeds as a portrait of the village’s traditions, both manual and cultural, brought to life by a largely nonprofessional cast (including Pamies, a striking discovery). Scenes involving pigeon races, farmers working the land with their hands, and women caring for and grooming each other all glow with a tactile sense of naturalism, which makes the documentary footage of floods that closes the film all the more gutting.

"‘Happiness for Beginners’ Review: Live, Laugh, Hike",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/movies/happiness-for-beginners-review.html,"In Happiness for Beginners,” directed by Vicky Wight, the “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” star Ellie Kemper portrays a divorced 30-something, Helen, on a journey of self-discovery and romance. Wight’s second adaptation of a novel by Katherine Center (after the 2020 drama “The Lost Husband”), the movie trades in warm-and-fuzzy predictability, where the most uprooting event imaginable for Kemper’s character is falling in love with her brother’s best friend, Jake (Luke Grimes), on a group hiking excursion along the Appalachian Trail.

“Happiness for Beginners” is inoffensive to a fault. Its gestures toward comedy largely stem from the ragtag, Patagonia-vested team of hikers surrounding the two lovers. Guided by a zealous leader, Beckett (Ben Cook), the group falls into stock stereotypes — an overconfident hunk, a self-deprecating gay man — who act as a ho-hum Greek chorus to Helen and Jake’s budding relationship. The movie is earnest when it wants to be, like when Jake recites poetry to Helen, but consistently backpedals to jokes about the hikers’ ineptitude and getting freaky in the woods. It’s as if the film is apologizing for its own tenderness.",0.3629251700680272,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/27/multimedia/27happiness-review-qckz/27happiness-review-qckz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['happiness', 'beginners', 'vicky wight', 'kimmy schmidt', '” star', 'ellie kemper', 'helen', 'wight', '’ s', 'katherine', 'drama “', 'lost husband', 'movie trades', 'warm-and-fuzzy predictability', 'kemper', '’ s character', 'brother ’ s', 'jake', 'luke grimes', 'appalachian', 'happiness', 'beginners', 'patagonia-vested', 'guided', 'zealous leader', 'beckett', 'ben cook', 'stock stereotypes —', 'overconfident hunk', 'gay man —', 'greek chorus', 'helen', 'jake', '’ s', 'jake', 'recites poetry', 'helen', 'hikers ’ ineptitude', '’ s', 'own tenderness']","[('Happiness for Beginners', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Vicky Wight', 'PERSON'), ('Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Ellie Kemper', 'PERSON'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('Helen', 'PERSON'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Katherine Center', 'PERSON'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('The Lost Husband', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Kemper', 'ORG'), ('Jake', 'PERSON'), ('Luke Grimes', 'PERSON'), ('the Appalachian Trail', 'FAC'), ('Happiness for Beginners', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Patagonia', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Beckett', 'PERSON'), ('Ben Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Greek', 'NORP'), ('Helen', 'PERSON'), ('Jake', 'PERSON'), ('Jake', 'PERSON'), ('Helen', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
"Kirstie Alley, star of 'Cheers' and films including 'Look Who's Talking,' dead at 71",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/kirstie-alley-obit/index.html,"CNN —

Actress Kirstie Alley, star of the big and small screens known for her Emmy-winning role on “Cheers” and films like “Look Who’s Talking,” has died after a brief battle with cancer, her children True and Lillie Parker announced on her social media.

She was 71.

“We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered,” the statement read.

“She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead,” the family’s statement continued. “As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother.”

“Our mother’s zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did,” the statement said.

A representative for Alley confirmed to CNN via email on Tuesday that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer prior to her death.

Career beginnings

A two-time Primetime Emmy Award winner, Alley was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1951.

After a standout role in 1982’s “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” she played roles in movies like 1984’s “Blind Date” and 1987’s “Summer School” opposite Mark Harmon.

That same year, Alley would follow Shelley Long to play the lead opposite Ted Danson in the latter part of TV classic sitcom “Cheers,” which premiered in 1982. Alley first appeared in 1987, playing strong and independent bar manager Rebecca Howe, staying on the acclaimed show until it ended in 1993.

After winning the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series in 1991 for “Cheers” and another for lead actress in a miniseries or special for 1994’s “David’s Mother,” she again found TV success in the late ’90s with series “Veronica’s Closet,” which scored her another Emmy nod.

Additionally, Alley starred in a number of memorable films, like the “Look Who’s Talking” movies, 1990’s “Madhouse” and 1999’s “Drop Dead Gorgeous” with Ellen Barkin.

In 2005, Alley co-wrote and starred in the Showtime comedy “Fat Actress” before making a foray into reality TV.

She appeared in “Kirstie Alley’s Big Life” in 2010, was a contestant on Season 12 of ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” the next year and placed second on Season 22 of the British version of “Celebrity Big Brother” in 2018. In 2022, she competed in Season 7 of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.”

Though she had an impressive body of work, the later part of her career was marked by Alley’s penchant for stirring controversy, especially through social media.

In a 2007 interview, Alley said she was proud of her no holds barred ways.

“I’ve always felt like if someone asks me something, they want the real answer,” Alley told Good Housekeeping. “I think there’s also something about being from Kansas. Usually people think I’m from New York. The only similarity between New Yorkers and Midwesterners is that what you see is what you get.”

‘Her charisma was always iconic’

John Travolta, who costarred with Alley in 1989’s hit “Look Who’s Talking” as well as two sequels, wrote on Instagram on Monday, “Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had. I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.”

Jamie Lee Curtis – who worked with Alley in 2016 on episodes of TV’s “Scream Queens” – shared a statement on Facebook to pay tribute to the late actress, writing, “She was a great comic foil in @tvscreamqueens and a beautiful mama bear in her very real life. She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas. We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.”

Josh Gad tweeted, “My heart breaks for Kirstie and her family. Whether it was her brilliance in ‘Cheers; or her magnetic performance in the ‘Look Who’s Talking’ franchise, her smile was always infectious, her laugh was always contagious and her charisma was always iconic. RIP.”

Alley’s “Cheers” co-star Ted Danson told Deadline he had just watched Alley in an episode of the show while on a plane before learning of her death.

“I was on a plane today and did something I rarely do. I watched an old episode of ‘Cheers,’” Danson told the outlet. “It was the episode where Tom Berenger proposes to Kirstie, who keeps saying no, even though she desperately wants to say yes. Kirstie was truly brilliant in it. Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.”

“She made me laugh 30 years ago when she shot that scene, and she made me laugh today just as hard. As I got off the plane, I heard that Kirstie had died. I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh,” Danson added. “I send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.”

Another “Cheers” star, Rhea Perlman, told CNN in a statement that she and Alley became friends instantly on the set of “Cheers.”

“Kirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend. Her joy of being was boundless,” Perlman said. “We became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too. We had sleepovers at her house, with treasure hunts that she created. She had massive Halloween and Easter parties and invited the entire crew of the show and their families. She wanted everyone to feel included. She loved her children deeply. I’ve never met anyone remotely like her. I feel so thankful to have known her. I’m going to miss her very, very much.”

“Baywatch” actor Parker Stevenson, who was married to Alley from 1983 to 1997 and is the father of her two children, also paid tribute to her on social media. In an Instagram post, confirmed to be Stevenson’s by a representative for the actor, he wrote: “Kirstie, I am so grateful for our years together, and for the two incredibly beautiful children and now grandchildren that we have. You will be missed.”",0.2222942057942059,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221205172141-kirstie-alley-2005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', '— actress', 'kirstie alley', 'small

John Travolta and Kirstie Alley: A love story,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/john-travolta-kirstie-alley/index.html,"CNN —

Kirstie Alley and John Travolta were never romantically involved, but that wasn’t how she initially wanted it.

Alley, who died Monday at the age of 71 after a brief illness, often talked of her feelings for Travolta, whom she called the “greatest love” of her life.

The pair starred together “Look Who’s Talking” film franchise (the first movie hit theaters in 1989). During an appearance in 2018 on “Celebrity Big Brother U.K.”, Alley talked about how easy it is to fall in love with leading men.

She named two co-stars she said she developed feelings for, but never fully consummated the attraction: Patrick Swayze and Travolta.

“I almost ran off and married John. I did love him, I still love him,” Alley said. “If I hadn’t been married I would’ve gone and married him and I would’ve been in an airplane because he has his [own plane.]”

The same year she appeared on the reality show, the “Cheers” star also talked about Travolta during a conversation on “The Dan Wootton Interview” podcast. She said not sleeping with the movie star was “the hardest decision I’ve ever made because I was madly in love with him.”

“We were fun and funny together,” she said. “It wasn’t a sexual relationship because I’m not going to cheat on my husband.”

Alley was married to actor Parker Stevenson at the time. The couple divorced in 1997.

In 2013, Alley told Howard Stern Travolta also had feelings for her, but didn’t act on them because of her marriage.

“It took me years to not look at John as a romantic interest,” she said.

Travolta married actress Kelly Preston in 1991. Alley told Wooten that Preston put her foot down about her flirting with her husband.

“Kelly came up to me and they were married then, and she said, ‘Why are you flirting with my husband?’” Alley said. “And that was sort of when I had to make a decision and that was pretty much the end of that.”

Travolta paid tribute to Alley on social media Monday.

“Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had,” he wrote in the caption on a post on his verified Instagram account. “I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.”",0.28103918650793647,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221206125515-02-john-travolta-kirstie-alley.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'kirstie alley', 'john travolta', 'wasn ’ t', 'alley', 'brief illness', 'travolta', 'who', '’ s', '” film franchise', 'celebrity', 'brother u.k.', 'alley', 'patrick swayze', 'travolta', 'john', 'alley', 'hadn ’ t', '’ ve', '’ ve', 'own plane', '] ”', 'reality show', 'cheers', '” star', 'travolta', 'dan wootton interview', '” podcast', 'movie star', 'hardest decision', '’ ve', 'him. ” “', 'wasn ’ t', 'sexual relationship', '’ m', 'husband. ”', 'alley', 'parker stevenson', 'alley', 'howard stern travolta', 'didn ’ t act', 'john', 'romantic interest', 'travolta', 'kelly preston', 'alley', 'wooten', 'preston', 'kelly', '’ ”', 'alley', 'that. ”', 'travolta', 'alley', 'social media', 'kirstie', 'special relationships', '’ ve', 'instagram', 'kirstie']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Kirstie Alley', 'PERSON'), ('John Travolta', 'PERSON'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('the age of 71', 'DATE'), ('Travolta', 'PERSON'), ('Look Who’s Talking', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('1989', 'DATE'), ('2018', 'DATE'), ('U.K.', 'GPE'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Patrick Swayze', 'PERSON'), ('Travolta', 'PERSON'), ('John', 'PERSON'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Cheers', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Travolta', 'PERSON'), ('The Dan Wootton', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Parker Stevenson', 'PERSON'), ('1997', 'DATE'), ('2013', 'DATE'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Howard Stern Travolta', 'PERSON'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('John', 'PERSON'), ('Kelly Preston', 'PERSON'), ('1991', 'DATE'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Wooten', 'PERSON'), ('Preston', 'PERSON'), ('Kelly', 'PERSON'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Alley', 'ORG'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Kirstie', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Kirstie', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
"'The Daily Show' reveals Chelsea Handler, Leslie Jones and John Leguizamo will guest host",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/chelsea-handler-leslie-jones-daily-show/index.html,"CNN —

The end of an era is fast approaching at Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” and the network has announced at least the first phase of plans for what’s to come next.

Following longtime host Trevor Noah’s imminent departure, the network shared this week that comedy legends including Al Franken, Chelsea Handler, D. L. Hughley, Leslie Jones, John Leguizamo, Hasan Minhaj, Kal Penn, Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes and Marlon Wayans will fill in as host of the late-night show starting Tuesday, January 17th, as part of its “next chapter”.

Comedy Central added that “Daily Show” correspondents and contributors are also “set to host with additional details to be announced.”

“As we enter Trevor’s final week, we want to thank him for his many contributions,” said Chris McCarthy, president/CEO of Paramount Media Networks, according to the network statement.

Trevor redefined the show, as did Jon Stewart before him, and as we look to the future, we are excited to reimagine it yet again with the help of this incredible list of talent and correspondents along with the immensely talented ‘Daily Show’ team.”

Noah’s final show is set to air this Thursday. The network has yet to announced whether guest hosts will revolve indefinitely or if a permanent, individual host will be named soon.

"Ashton Kutcher and twin Michael talk health, guilt and rift between them",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/ashton-kutcher-michael/index.html,"CNN —

In a rare interview, twin brothers Ashton and Michael Kutcher talked about both their bond and their rift.

The pair appeared on the new Paramount+ series “The Checkup with Dr. David Agus.”

Agus, who is Ashton Kutcher’s doctor, first spoke with the actor about his battle with the autoimmune condition vasculitis.

Later he sat down with the brothers to talk about Michael Kutcher having cerebral palsy and also the moment he almost died as a youngster after contracting viral myocarditis that caused his heart to become enlarged and fail.

The brothers both got emotional about Michael’s heart stopping while Ashton was visiting him in the intensive care unit.

“I go in the room and I’m like ‘Whoa,’” Ashton Kutcher said, fighting back tears. “I’m like…’Everything is not ok.’ And he flatlines in the room and I know that noise cause now I’ve been visiting occasionally.”

He said he considered jumping off a balcony to help his brother since his heart would be a match. Michael Kutcher did receive a donor heart in 24 hours.

He later had to have open heart surgery after a blood clot was discovered. Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher’s career as a model and actor started taking off and he said he felt guilt.

The “That 70s Show” star said he wondered, “How do I get to be this lucky?”

“For my brother…to be born with cerebral palsy, then have a heart transplant, then have this random blood clot, these things that you’re just like, ‘Who has to go through that?,’” he said.

Michael Kutcher eventually called him out, he said.

“He looked at me and he said, ‘Every time you feel sorry for me, you make me less,’” Ashton Kutcher said. “He said ‘This is the only life I’ve ever known, so stop feeling sorry for the only thing I have.’ And that then created an entire shift back to where I think we are today, which is straight up equals again.”

Michael Kutcher told Agus the brothers drifted apart because of jealousy on his part after his brother became “a household name.”

“There was a moment when I viewed him as receiving more attention than I was,” Michael Kutcher said. “That kind of drove me down to a place where I was jealous.”

The brothers talked it through, Michael Kutcher said, adding, “And once I took all of the fame and everything out of it, I was able to just, you know, come back to him.”

They also had an issue after the actor shared publicly that his brother had cerebral palsy, something Michael Kutcher had not shared. Ashton Kutcher said during the interview that he was not aware that his brother had been keeping it a secret.

'Mickey 17' gets trailer and release date,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/bong-joon-ho-mickey-17-trailer-new-movie/index.html,"CNN —

A first look at “Parasite” director Bong Joon Ho’s new movie is here.

Based off the book “Mickey 7” by Edward Ashto, the Oscar winner penned the screenplay for “Mickey 17,” which may veer from the novel in some places.

The film is being produced by Plan B Entertainment and the score is by composer Jae-il Jung, who also provided the music for “Parasite.”

At the 2020 Academy Awards, “Parasite” picked up best picture, best director, best international feature film and best original screenplay.

The book follows Mickey 7, who is an employee on a human expedition sent to colonize the ice world Niflheim. Mickey 7 takes on missions that are too dangerous for the others, and has already had six iterations of his life.

Blackpink named Time Entertainer of the Year 2022,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/blackpink-time-entertainer-of-the-year-2022-intl-scli/index.html,"CNN —

Global pop sensation Blackpink have been chosen as Time magazine’s 2022 Entertainer of the Year, making the four-woman band the second K-pop artists to earn the title, after BTS in 2020.

Selected by YG Entertainment, a big South Korean record label that screens performers for star quality and trains them intensively, the quartet – Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé – found international stardom quickly after their 2016 debut.

Their first LP, “The Album,” sold more than one million copies in less than a month after its 2020 release.

In a Time feature marking the Entertainer of the Year award, the group revisited their journey, from playing at Coachella in 2019 to performing “Pink Venom” at the VMAs earlier this year.

“We put in a lot of work so we could look like superwomen,” rapper Jennie told Time. “We’re very normal girls, at the end of the day.”

Talking about their success – and the pressures that come with it – Jennie said the band perform from the heart.

“If we consider this in the business way, we wouldn’t be able to do this,” she said.

Gabourey Sidibe reveals she’s been secretly married for over a year,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/gabourey-sidibe-married-brandon-frankel/index.html,"CNN —

It turns out that Gabourey Sidibe has been even busier than previously thought since the beginning of the pandemic.

Not only did the Oscar-nominated actress get engaged, she also secretly got married well over a year ago.

The “breaking news” was revealed during a lively interview on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on Monday, in which Sidibe revealed further details on her now husband Brandon Frankel’s engagement proposal in late 2020, as well as their secret wedding in March 2021.

“The thing about weddings is I don’t like them. I don’t like them,” the “Precious” star explained to the hosts. “Here’s an example of how much I don’t like them: I’m actually married. We got married over a year ago.”

The revelation left Ryan Seacrest “confused,” while Kelly Rippa asked if this was indeed “breaking news.”

Frankel, an entertainment business executive, was seen in the audience, confirming the news by raising his hand to show a bejeweled ring finger.

Sidibe went on to share that they were married “at the kitchen table,” and the ceremony was so small, it was “just us.”

She did allow that they will eventually have a wedding to placate her mother-in-law, but that her distaste for the affairs stems from the fact that the actress’s own mother was a wedding singer, meaning she’s “been at a lot of weddings, uninvited” herself.

Frankel posted a series of pictures of the couple showing off their rings to his Instagram also on Monday, writing, “SURPRISE! I can finally call her my WIFE publicly!”

He went on to say that after Sidibe “spilled the beans” on “Live,” he feels “relieved we can finally tell the world.”

“So thankful to have found my forever person, my partner-in-crime, and the love of my life. Every day is the best day with you,” Frankel added. “Nobody I would rather raise cats with and be in bed by a smooth 8pm with. Love you forever”",0.12855477855477854,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221205162210-gabourey-sidibe-brandon-frankel-marriage-announcement.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'gabourey sidibe', 'oscar-nominated', 'news ”', 'lively interview', 'live', 'kelly', 'ryan', 'sidibe', 'brandon frankel', '’ s engagement proposal', 'secret wedding', 'march', 'don ’ t', 'don ’ t', 'precious', '” star', '’ s', 'don ’ t', '’ m', 'year ago. ”', 'ryan seacrest', 'kelly rippa', 'news. ”', 'frankel', 'entertainment business executive', 'ring finger', 'sidibe', 'kitchen table', 'us. ”', 'actress ’ s', 'own mother', 'wedding singer', '’ s “', 'frankel', 'instagram', 'surprise', 'wife', 'sidibe', 'beans ”', 'live', 'world. ” “', 'frankel', 'smooth 8pm', 'love']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Gabourey Sidibe', 'PERSON'), ('Oscar', 'PERSON'), ('a year ago', 'DATE'), ('Live with Kelly', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Ryan', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Sidibe', 'PERSON'), ('Brandon Frankel', 'PERSON'), ('late 2020', 'DATE'), ('March 2021', 'DATE'), ('a year ago', 'DATE'), ('Ryan Seacrest', 'PERSON'), ('Kelly Rippa', 'PERSON'), ('Frankel', 'PERSON'), ('Sidibe', 'PERSON'), ('Frankel', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Sidibe', 'PERSON'), ('the best day', 'DATE'), ('Frankel', 'PERSON'), ('8pm', 'TIME')]",Entertainment

Jill Scott announces ‘Who is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. 1’ 23rd anniversary tour,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/jill-scott-tour-music/index.html,"CNN —

After a 20th-anniversary tour of Jill Scott’s chart-topping album, “Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds Vol I” was forced to end prematurely due to the pandemic, it will resume.

Scott has announced that she’ll be back on the road next year for shows during which she will play the album in full, including her hits like “Gettin’ in the Way,” “A Long Walk” and other songs.

The tour, produced by Live Nation Urban, will play in over 20 markets across the country. Scott will also have special multi-show residencies in Washington, D.C. at the MGM National Harbor on Mother’s Day weekend and Scott’s hometown of Philadelphia at The MET Philadelphia. It marks the first time the North Philadelphia native will play there.

The Philadelphia stop will feature a fundraiser at the Arden Theatre in support of Scott’s non-profit, the Blues Babe Foundation.

“My band and I were so excited three years ago, but that damn COVID shut us down,” Scott said in a press release. “Now, we outside! Come see me. Come feel again. Relive your favorite moments. Ya’ll ready to settle down and get with this?!? It’s a lot of love here.”

Scott released her debut record in July 2000. It went double platinum album and earned her several Grammy nominations, including best new artist (2001), best R&B album (2001), and best female R&B vocal performance for three years in a row (2001-2003).

Adam Sandler still gets emotional singing Chris Farley song,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/adam-sandler-chris-farley-song-snl/index.html,"CNN —

Adam Sandler will always Chris Farley.

More than twenty years after Farley’s death, Sandler still gets sad when he sings the “Chris Farley Song,” a song he wrote for his late friend and comedian, who died in December 1997 of a drug overdose at age 33.

Sandler told the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that his musical tribute still makes him emotional. He performed the song as part of his Netflix special “Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh” and sang it on “SNL” when he hosted in May 2019.

“The first few times, we played that song, I would tear up and I couldn’t really sing it well because I’d get so emotional, and then I felt it and was able to get it out there,” Sandler said on the podcast. “It’s weird, but when that song starts, I go, ‘Oh f–k, alright, don’t cry and don’t do that’ still. I’ve sang it maybe a hundred times already, but it rocks me.”

Sandler added, “I think it’s because we show a video of Chris and I see his face.” He also said “hearing the crowd go nuts for Farley” makes him happy.

Neil Diamond sang “Sweet Caroline” at the Broadway opening of his musical” A Beautiful Noise,” five years after retiring due to his Parkinson’s diagnosis.

Diamond stopped touring in January 2018, but brought the audience to their feet with his rendition of “Caroline” at the Broadhurst Theatre on Sunday, with his wife Katie McNeil by his side.

It was a rare public outing for the singer.

The musical tracks Diamond’s life, and his path to becoming a successful solo artist after first writing songs for other performers.

The rock legend last performed a full concert at the Forum in Los Angeles in August 2017.

George Clooney has a simple strategy for staying out of trouble as a public figure,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/entertainment/george-clooney-star-social-media/index.html,"CNN —

George Clooney has a surefire way for staying out of trouble as a public figure in the age of social media: stay off of it.

In a profile for the Washington Post published on Friday, the Oscar-winning actor said he manages to avoid too much exposure to today’s 24/7 media cycle by not engaging on those platforms, which he acknowledges would be problematic “if I have three drinks at night.”

He also shared, “I don’t think you can be a star and be that available.”

It was part of a larger conversation in which Clooney identified how certain movie stars that came before him like Gregory Peck and Paul Newman – both of whom were friends of his before they died – exemplified how to carry oneself in the spotlight.

“It doesn’t mean you can’t be goofy and do stupid things, but it means stand up for the things you believe in, carry yourself with a little bit of dignity,” the “Ticket to Paradise” star said. “And both of them had great humor about themselves.”

Clooney, who is being honored at the Kennedy Center this month alongside Gladys Knight and U2, among others, is active in humanitarian efforts in addition to his pursuits as an actor, producer and director.

Ethan Hawke, who directed Clooney in a voice role as Newman in this year’s HBO documentary “The Last Movie Stars,” observed that it’s no surprise he’s getting such a prestigious honor. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

“It’s interesting that he’s getting the Kennedy Center Honors this year because Newman got it too. They fit in a long line of really responsible artists, people who make a contribution to American culture and are civic leaders,” Hawke told the Post. “Whether you like George’s politics, or admire where he gives his money and time, you have to admire his willingness to lead, and his willingness to care.”

Steven Soderbergh, whose 1998 masterpiece “Out of Sight” starred Clooney opposite Jennifer Lopez, said the actor is unique for not caring that his politics might compromise the reach of his stardom.

“The default mode really doesn’t lead you to a place of thinking about fairness, or defending people who can’t defend themselves. It’s great when people use that juice for those purposes, but that’s not the way the stream flows,” Soderbergh said of Clooney’s efforts through his Clooney Foundation for Justice alongside wife Amal, a human rights attorney.

“The stream flows in the direction of self-orientation and being in a mode of extracting whatever you can from this business, and whatever you can from the world at large. … He’s one of the few people who punches upward. That’s rare.”

Ben Affleck says Netflix’s ‘assembly line’ approach to making quality films is ‘an impossible job’,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/entertainment/ben-affleck-netflix-assembly-line/index.html,"CNN —

Ben Affleck is sounding off on how movies are being made in today’s age of Netflix and other streaming platforms, which offer an ever-expanding glut of content.

The actor, producer and director, who is starting a new film studio of his own with friend and colleague Matt Damon alongside RedBird Capital Partners, shared his take on Netflix’s approach to moviemaking, which he likened to an “assembly line.”

Making films “is a thing that requires attention and dedication and work and it resists the sort of assembly line process,” Affleck shared in reference to Netflix, while attending the New York Times 2022 DealBook Conference last week.

“[Netflix’s head of original films] Scott Stuber is a really talented, smart guy who I really like…but it’s an impossible job,” he added.

The “Argo” star also said that if you ask Netflix co-CEO and chairman Reed Hastings about their ambitious approach of making 50 great movies, “he’d say, ‘Hey, we went for quantity to establish a footprint.’ I’m sure there’s wisdom in that and I’m sure they had a great strategy, but I would have said, ‘How are we going to make 50 great movies a year? How is that possible?’ There’s no committee big enough. There aren’t enough – you just can’t do it.”

Affleck acknowledged that “there’s (a) bigger audience for action movies than there is for small dramas. I get that. Certain genres play more broadly and you can’t not be mindful of that. But let’s do a good one, let’s surprise the audience, let’s make them care about it.”

At Artists Equity, which is being branded as a creator-led studio, Affleck and company hope to reimagine the relationships between studios, artists and crews working in the industry.

As seen in Variety, Artists Equity already has a first project in production – a yet-to-be-titled drama about the beginnings of Nike’s incredibly popular Air Jordan sneaker brand. Written and directed by Affleck, the film stars Damon as the executive who landed the endorsement deal for the shoe with Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan.",0.2465710678210678,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221204180118-ben-affleck-netflix-assembly-line.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'ben affleck', '’ s age', 'netflix', 'new film studio', 'matt damon', 'redbird capital partners', 'netflix', '’ s approach', '“ assembly line. ”', 'making', 'films “', 'assembly line process', 'affleck', 'netflix', 'york', 'dealbook', '“ [', 'netflix', '’ s head', 'original films ]', 'scott stuber', 'smart guy', '’ s', 'impossible job', 'argo', '” star', 'netflix', 'reed hastings', 'ambitious approach', 'great movies', '’ d', 'hey', 'footprint. ’', '’ m', '’ s wisdom', '’ m', 'great strategy', 'great movies', '’ s', 'aren ’ t', '’ t', 'it. ”', 'affleck', '’ s', 'action movies', 'small dramas', 'certain genres', '’ t', '’ s', '’ s surprise', '’ s', 'it. ”', 'artists equity', 'affleck', 'company hope', 'variety', 'artists equity', 'production –', 'nike', '’ s', 'popular air', 'jordan', 'sneaker brand', 'written', 'affleck', 'film stars', 'damon', 'chicago bulls', 'michael jordan']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Ben Affleck', 'PERSON'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Netflix', 'ORG'), ('Matt Damon', 'PERSON'), ('Capital Partners', 'ORG'), ('Netflix', 'ORG'), ('Affleck', 'PERSON'), ('Netflix', 'ORG'), ('the New York Times', 'ORG'), ('2022 DealBook Conference', 'EVENT'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('Netflix', 'ORG'), ('Scott Stuber', 'PERSON'), ('Argo', 'ORG'), ('Netflix', 'ORG'), ('Reed Hastings', 'PERSON'), ('50', 'CARDINAL'), ('50', 'CARDINAL'), ('Affleck', 'PERSON'), ('Artists Equity', 'ORG'), ('Affleck', 'PERSON'), ('Variety, Artists Equity', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Nike', 'ORG'), ('Air Jordan', 'ORG'), ('Affleck', 'PERSON'), ('Damon', 'PERSON'), ('Chicago Bulls', 'ORG'), ('Michael Jordan', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
Keke Palmer reveals baby bump as part of her ‘Saturday Night Live’ opening monologue,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/entertainment/keke-palmer-baby-bump-snl-monologue/index.html,"CNN —

Some people like singing their good news from the rooftops, but in Keke Palmer’s case, it was done on live television in front of millions of viewers.

The actress and comedian hosted “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, and during her opening monologue, revealed she is pregnant with her first child.

The “Hustlers” star wore a trench coat with snap buttons and said she wanted “to set the record straight” about some “rumors going around” that she’s having a baby.

“I am!” she continued, whipping open her coat to reveal her bare baby bump underneath.

While closing the clasps on her coat, Palmer then added, “I gotta say, it is bad when people on the Internet spread rumors about you, but it’s even worse when they’re correct!”

She then joked how she had been trying to keep her pregnancy on the “down low” for fear of losing some sponsorship deals, including one with a liquor label.

Christine McVie’s music: 5 songs to listen to in her honor,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/christine-mcvie-music/index.html,"CNN —

There’s a reason why Christine McVie was considered the heart of Fleetwood Mac.

The band’s keyboardist, who died Wednesday after a brief illness at the age of 79, was also the writer of some of the group’s most beloved songs.

Here are just five of those tunes:

“You Make Loving Fun”

This one is tied to some drama.

Fleetwood Mac is known for, in part, their tumultuous relationships, especially when it came to romantic ones.

Band members Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had a thing that ended badly and McVie was famously married to, and then divorced from, their other bandmate, John McVie.

He reportedly thought the song, with its lyrics “Sweet wonderful you/You make me happy with the things you do/Oh, can it be so/This feeling follows me wherever I go,” was about their dog as the McVies were married at the time.

But it turns out Christine McVie had penned the love song in honor of the band’s lighting director with whom she had an affair.

“Don’t Stop”

Another tune from their famed “Rumours” album.

“Don’t Stop” proved to be a hopeful anthem for the future, which was so meaningful to former President Bill Clinton that he used it as his 1992 campaign anthem.

On Wednesday he tweeted a tribute to McVie.

“I’m saddened by the passing of Christine McVie. “Don’t Stop” was my ’92 campaign theme song - it perfectly captured the mood of a nation eager for better days,” he tweeted. “I’m grateful to Christine & Fleetwood Mac for entrusting us with such a meaningful song. I will miss her.”

“Got a Hold on Me”

This one was actually a solo song for McVie.

The first single off of her self-titled solo album, it sounds like it could be a Fleetwood Mac song with it’s buoyant rhythm and the infectious chorus, “Ooh, I got a love/I got somebody/This love got a hold on me.”

Plus Buckingham plays guitar on this one, giving it even more of a Fleetwood Mac vibe.

“Say You Love Me”

“Say You Love Me” is a jaunty tune that has become a mainstay on rock and easy listening radio stations.

She reflected on the sweet harmonies, she, Nicks and Buckingham achieve on the tune in a 1990 interview.

“The first time I started playing ‘Say You Love Me’ and I reached the chorus, they started singing with me and fell right into it,” Performing Songwriter magazine reported her saying. “I heard this incredible sound, our three voices … and my skin turned to gooseflesh.”

“Songbird”

It feels right that so many on social media used this song to pay tribute to McVie after her passing.

The ballad she wrote has been pointed to as the perfect remembrance of someone lost.

Playing it now after her death seems haunting as she pours her heart into the opening lyrics, “For you, there’ll be no more crying/For you, the sun will be shining/And I feel that when I’m with you/It’s alright, I know it’s right.”",0.3351757369614513,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221201130335-christine-mcvie-1990-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', '’ s', 'christine mcvie', 'fleetwood mac', 'band ’ s keyboardist', 'brief illness', 'group ’ s', 'loving fun', 'fleetwood mac', 'tumultuous relationships', 'romantic ones', 'band members', 'stevie nicks', 'lindsey buckingham', 'mcvie', 'john mcvie', 'lyrics “', 'sweet wonderful you/you', 'so/this feeling', 'mcvies', 'christine mcvie', 'band ’ s', 'don', '’ t', 'stop', 'famed “', 'rumours', '” album', 'don', '’ t', 'stop', 'bill clinton', 'campaign anthem', 'mcvie', '’ m', 'christine mcvie', 'don', '’ t', 'stop', 'campaign theme song', '’ m', 'christine', 'fleetwood mac', 'meaningful song', 'her. ” “', 'got', 'hold', 'solo song', 'mcvie', 'solo album', 'fleetwood mac', '’ s buoyant rhythm', 'infectious chorus', 'ooh', 'me. ”', 'buckingham', 'plays guitar', 'fleetwood mac', 'say', 'love', '” “', 'say', 'love', 'jaunty tune', 'radio stations', 'sweet harmonies', 'nicks', 'buckingham', 'say', 'love', 'performing songwriter', 'voices …', 'gooseflesh. ” “', 'songbird', 'social media', 'mcvie', 'perfect remembrance', 'playing', 'opening lyrics', '’ ll', '’ m', 'you/it ’ s alright', '’ s']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Christine McVie', 'PERSON'), ('Fleetwood Mac', 'ORG'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('the age of 79', 'DATE'), ('just five', 'CARDINAL'), ('You Make Loving Fun', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Fleetwood Mac', 'ORG'), ('Stevie Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('Lindsey Buckingham', 'PERSON'), ('McVie', 'PERSON'), ('John McVie', 'PERSON'), ('Sweet', 'PERSON'), ('McVies', 'FAC'), ('Christine McVie', 'PERSON'), ('Don’t Stop', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Don’t Stop', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Bill Clinton', 'PERSON'), ('1992', 'DATE'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('McVie', 'PERSON'), ('Christine McVie', 'PERSON'), ('’92', 'DATE'), ('better days', 'DATE'), ('Christine & Fleetwood Mac', 'ORG'), ('McVie', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Fleetwood Mac', 'ORG'), ('Fleetwood Mac', 'ORG'), ('Say You Love Me', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Say You Love Me', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('Buckingham', 'PERSON'), ('1990', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Say You Love Me’ and I', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Performing Songwriter magazine', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('McVie', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment
Axl Rose will stop tossing mic after fan reportedly injured,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/axl-rose-microphone/index.html,"CNN —

Axl Rose is ending a 30-year Guns N’ Roses tradition.

The band’s frontman recently posted a note saying on social media that he would no longer be tossing his microphone into the crowd during their concerts after it came to his attention that a fan may have been hurt at their recent show in Adelaide, Australia.

“If true, obviously we don’t want anyone getting hurt or to somehow in any way hurt anyone at any of [our] shows anyway,” Rose wrote in a note he tweeted. “Having tossed the mic at the end of [our] show for over 30 years we always felt it was a known part of the very end of [our] performance that fans wanted and were aware of to have an opportunity to catch the mic.”

He thanked the band’s supporters for understanding.

'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny': Harrison Ford cracks the whip in teaser trailer,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-teaser-trailer/index.html,"CNN —

It’s a name so iconic, he comes with his own theme song, and boy, is it a sweet sound.

In the new teaser trailer for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Harrison Ford returns as the titular hero archaeologist, this time alongside “Fleabag” star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

In this fifth installment, directed by James Mangold, Jones jumps back into action – albeit seemingly reluctantly – to once again go on a grand adventure, despite thinking that his risk-taking days have “come and gone.”

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny | Teaser Trailer

Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson and Mads Mikkelsen are part of the cast for the new movie.

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas served as executive producers, with John Williams, who has scored each Indy adventure since the original “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981, once again serving as composer.

Back in September, Ford appeared at Disney’s D23 convention and teased the action to come.

“Indiana Jones movies are about mystery and adventure but they’re also about heart,” he said.

'Willow' review: Warwick Davis returns in Lucasfilm's series sequel for Disney+,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/entertainment/willow-review/index.html,"CNN —

Disney’s press materials refer to the original 1988 movie “Willow” as “beloved,” which despite its admirers feels like nostalgic inflation of a pretty generic George Lucas-plotted fantasy that provided an early directing showcase for Ron Howard. Setting that aside, a Disney+ revival series isn’t without its charms, in a more contemporary narrative that brings back Warwick Davis while focusing on the next generation.

The series begins by recounting the events of the movie, which saw Davis’ simple farmer Willow turn sorcerer and join in a fierce battle to protect a baby who carried the kingdom’s destiny on her tiny shoulders, overcoming ancient evil with the help of the swordsman Madmartigan and (eventually) princess Sorsha. The latter were played by Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley, respectively, who as an off-screen bonus got married after the film.

Kilmer, amid his struggle with cancer, remains out of the picture, but Whalley returns as the now-queen and mother of two headstrong grown children, who play roles in a mythical quest that requires journeying across treacherous lands to thwart the evil crone.

As for the aforementioned baby, Elora Danan, she has grown up in anonymity, “Sleeping Beauty”-like, to protect her, although her identity (a not-to-be-revealed spoiler) soon becomes known. The quest includes a colorful band with plenty of youthful relationship issues, including Princess Kit (Ruby Cruz), who is secretly in love with the knight charged with training her (Erin Kellyman, whose credits include Lucasfilm’s “Solo: A Star Wars Story”); and Boorman (Amar Chadha-Patel), an irreverent brawler in the Madmartigan mode.

Jonathan Kasdan (who also worked on “Solo”) serves as showrunner, collaborating with four directors who each oversaw back-to-back episodes. As constructed, “Willow” draws upon the original while weaving in flourishes that recall the “Lord of the Rings” movies, including lots of sweeping green countryside and abundant, occasionally quite-violent action.

As is so often the case with the growing subgenre of expanded-to-series sequels, this “Willow” at times feels as if it’s spinning its wheels, devoting lengthy stretches to Willow guiding the now-older Elora to master her powers, which he presents as the only hope of saving the kingdom. And while Kilmer’s absence leaves a sizable hole Kasdan and company do a reasonably good job of filling it, including the late arrival of another knight (Christian Slater) with whom Madmartigan shared some history.

Beyond modern-sounding dialogue and situations, the story does exhibit plenty of playful irreverence and humor mixed in among the action sequences and elaborate fantasy production design. The latter in particular suggest that this revival was no small undertaking, and to its credit, it looks like that money ended up on the screen.

While that combination doesn’t add up into making “Willow” significantly worthier of the “beloved” label than its late-’80s predecessor, consumed on its own unpretentious terms, it’s easy enough to like.

‘Love Actually’ director feels ‘a bit stupid’ about movie’s lack of diversity,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/love-actually-richard-curtis-diversity-scli-intl/index.html,"CNN —

Every year, as the days grow colder and Christmas draws nearer, “Love Actually” quickly becomes a festive favorite on people’s television screens.

But nearly 20 years on from the release of the 2003 romantic comedy, the movie has faced scrutiny over its story lines and lack of diversity.

“There were things you’d change but thank god society is changing. So my film is bound, in some moments, to feel, you know, out of date,” the movie’s writer and director Richard Curtis said earlier this week.

He was speaking to Diane Sawyer as part of a documentary on ABC News titled: “The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later.”

“Love Actually” features interweaving story lines, following several romantic relationships. However, most of the leading cast is White and all the relationships depicted are heterosexual.

Asked about any moments that might make him “wince,” Curtis said: “The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.” He added: “I think there are three plots that have bosses and people who work for them.”

The movie features an impressive number of big names from the entertainment industry, with Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman, Laura Linney, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster all appearing at some point.

Nearly 20 years on, “Love Actually” remains popular, becoming a staple of the holiday season.

“It’s amazing the way it’s entered the language,” Nighy said in the ABC News documentary.

“I’ve had people coming up to me saying ‘it got me through my chemotherapy,’ or ‘it got me through my divorce,’ or ‘I watch it whenever I’m alone.’ And people do, and people have ‘Love Actually’ parties.”

When asked if she understood why “Love Actually” had remained popular, Thompson replied: “I so do.”

“Because I think that we forget, time and time again we forget, that love is all that matters.”

Curtis has written several other popular romantic comedies, including “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”

“Four Weddings and a Funeral” was released in 1994 and notably portrayed a same-sex relationship between Matthew, played by John Hannah, and Gareth, played by Simon Callow.

Writing in the Guardian 14 years later, Callow said: “It almost defies belief, but in the months after the release of the film, I received a number of letters from apparently intelligent, articulate members of the public saying that they had never realised, until seeing the film, that gay people had emotions like normal people.”",0.21358695652173915,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221201105101-01-love-actually-diversity.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'christmas', 'draws nearer', 'love', 'people ’ s television screens', 'romantic comedy', 'story lines', '’ d', 'god society', 'movie ’ s writer', 'richard curtis', 'diane sawyer', 'abc', 'laughter', 'secrets', 'love', 'years later.', '” “', 'love', 'story lines', 'romantic relationships', '“ wince', 'curtis', 'bit stupid. ”', 'them. ”', 'impressive number', 'big names', 'entertainment industry', 'alan rickman', 'emma thompson', 'hugh grant', 'chiwetel ejiofor', 'keira knightley', 'bill nighy', 'colin firth', 'liam neeson', 'martin freeman', 'laura linney', 'martine mccutcheon', 'rowan atkinson', 'thomas brodie-sangster', 'hugh grant', 'british prime minister', 'martine mccutcheon', 'universal/dna/working title/koba/shutterstock', 'love', 'holiday season', '’ s', '’ s', 'nighy', 'abc', 'news documentary', '’ ve', '’ m alone. ’', 'love', '’ parties. ”', 'love', 'thompson', 'do. ” “', 'matters. ”', 'curtis', 'popular romantic comedies', 'weddings', '” “', 'notting', 'hill ”', 'bridget jones', '’ s', 'diary.', '” “', 'weddings', 'funeral ”', 'same-sex relationship', 'matthew', 'john hannah', 'gareth', 'simon callow', 'writing', 'guardian', 'callow', 'defies belief', 'articulate members', 'gay people', 'normal people']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('the days', 'DATE'), ('Christmas', 'DATE'), ('Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('nearly 20 years', 'DATE'), ('2003', 'DATE'), ('Richard Curtis', 'PERSON'), ('earlier this week', 'DATE'), ('Diane Sawyer', 'PERSON'), ('ABC News', 'ORG'), ('The Laughter & Secrets of Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('20 Years Later', 'DATE'), ('Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('White', 'PERSON'), ('Curtis', 'PERSON'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Alan Rickman', 'PERSON'), ('Emma Thompson', 'PERSON'), ('Hugh Grant', 'PERSON'), ('Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'PERSON'), ('Keira Knightley', 'PERSON'), ('Bill Nighy', 'PERSON'), ('Colin Firth', 'PERSON'), ('Liam Neeson', 'PERSON'), ('Martin Freeman', 'PERSON'), ('Laura Linney', 'PERSON'), ('Martine McCutcheon', 'PERSON'), ('Rowan Atkinson', 'PERSON'), ('Thomas Brodie-Sangster', 'PERSON'), ('Hugh Grant', 'PERSON'), ('British', 'NORP'), ('Martine McCutcheon', 'PERSON'), ('Universal/Dna/Working Title/Koba/Shutterstock', 'ORG'), ('Nearly 20 years', 'DATE'), ('Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the holiday season', 'DATE'), ('Nighy', 'PERSON'), ('ABC News', 'ORG'), ('Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Love', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Thompson', 'ORG'), ('Curtis', 'PERSON'), ('Four Weddings', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Notting Hill', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Bridget Jones’s Diary', 'PERSON'), ('Four Weddings', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1994', 'DATE'), ('Matthew', 'PERSON'), ('John Hannah', 'PERSON'), ('Gareth', 'PERSON'), ('Simon Callow', 'PERSON'), ('Guardian', 'ORG'), ('14 years later', 'DATE'), ('Callow', 'PERSON'), ('the months', 'DATE')]",Entertainment
Joe Pesci says playing Harry in the ‘Home Alone’ films came with some ‘serious’ pain,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/entertainment/joe-pesci-burns-home-alone-2/index.html,"CNN —

They say artists have to be willing to do anything for their art, and for Joe Pesci, that includes setting his head on fire.

In a new interview with People, the Oscar winner reflected on the making “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” on the occasion of the sequel’s 30th anniversary and remembered how the comedy required some physically “demanding” stunts on his part.

“It was a nice change of pace to do that particular type of slapstick comedy,” Pesci said of making the first two “Home Alone” films in the email interview, published on Tuesday.

In the uber-successful franchise, Pesci played one half a bungling thief duo (alongside Daniel Stern) who is continually one-upped by a clever kid played by Macaulay Culkin. He acknowledged that the movies “were a more physical type of comedy, therefore, a little more demanding.”

One example – when Pesci’s character Harry walks unsuspectingly into a booby trap laid by Culkin’s Kevin, leading to a fiery finish.

“In addition to the expected bumps, bruises, and general pains that you would associate with that particular type of physical humor, I did sustain serious burns to the top of my head during the scene where Harry’s hat is set on fire,” the “Goodfellas” star recalled.

In fact, Harry’s head is set ablaze not once but twice in the movies, once in 1990’s “Home Alone” and again in the 1992 film, when Harry and Marv (Stern) chase Kevin through a house amid renovations. (Pesci did not clarify during which film he sustained his injury.)

Pesci added that he “was fortunate enough to have professional stuntmen do the real heavy stunts.”

“Home Alone 2,” which hit theaters on November 20, 1992, welcomed back Pesci, Culkin and Stern along with Catherine O’Hara and John Heard as Kevin’s parents. The movie also starred Oscar-winning actress Brenda Fricker as the Pigeon Lady.",0.11813446969696965,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221130163523-joe-pesci-home-alone-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'joe pesci', 'new interview', 'oscar', '“ home', 'alone', 'lost', 'york', 'sequel ’ s', '” stunts', 'particular type', 'slapstick comedy', 'pesci', '“ home', 'alone', '” films', 'email interview', 'uber-successful franchise', 'pesci', 'thief duo', 'daniel stern', 'clever kid', 'macaulay culkin', 'movies “', 'physical type', 'demanding. ”', 'example –', 'pesci', '’ s character', 'harry', 'booby trap', 'culkin', '’ s', 'kevin', 'fiery finish', 'general pains', 'particular type', 'physical humor', 'serious burns', 'harry', '’ s hat', 'goodfellas', '” star', 'harry', '’ s head', '’ s “ home', 'alone', 'harry', 'marv', 'stern', 'kevin', 'pesci', 'pesci', 'professional stuntmen', 'real heavy stunts. ” “ home', 'alone', 'november', 'pesci', 'culkin', 'stern', 'catherine', 'o ’', 'hara', 'john heard', 'kevin', '’ s parents', 'oscar-winning', 'brenda fricker', 'pigeon']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Joe Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('Oscar', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Home Alone 2: Lost in', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('New York', 'GPE'), ('30th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('one half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Daniel Stern', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Macaulay Culkin', 'PERSON'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('Harry', 'PERSON'), ('Culkin', 'PERSON'), ('Kevin', 'PERSON'), ('Harry', 'PERSON'), ('Harry', 'PERSON'), ('1990', 'DATE'), ('1992', 'DATE'), ('Harry', 'PERSON'), ('Marv', 'PERSON'), ('Kevin', 'ORG'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('Home Alone 2', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('November 20, 1992', 'DATE'), ('Pesci', 'PERSON'), ('Culkin', 'PERSON'), ('Stern', 'PERSON'), ('Catherine O’Hara', 'PERSON'), ('John Heard', 'PERSON'), ('Kevin', 'PERSON'), ('Oscar', 'PERSON'), ('Brenda Fricker', 'PERSON')]",Entertainment

Throughout the various personal turmoils for which the members of Fleetwood Mac are known, one relationship buoyed the band for decades: the friendship between its two frontwomen, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks.

McVie joined the band in 1970 during one of its early lineup changes and for years was its only woman. When Nicks was added to the lineup in 1975, the two became fast friends.

Theirs was not a competitive relationship, but a sisterly one – both women were gifted songwriters responsible for crafting many of the band’s best-known tunes. Though the two grew apart in the 1980s amid Nicks’ worsening drug addiction and the band’s growing internal tension, they came back together when McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac in 2014.

At a concert in London, shortly before McVie officially rejoined the band, Nicks dedicated the song “Landslide” to her “mentor. Big sister. Best friend.” And at the show’s end, McVie was there, accompanying her bandmates for “Don’t Stop.”

“I never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends,” Nicks told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.

On Wednesday, McVie, the band’s “songbird,” died after a brief illness at age 79. Below, revisit McVie’s and Nicks’ years-long relationship as bandmates, best friends and “sisters.”

McVie and Nicks hit it off from the start

The story of Nicks joining Fleetwood Mac is legend now: Band founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to recruit guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who stipulated that he would only join if his girlfriend and musician Nicks could join, too. McVie cast the deciding vote, and the rest is history.

“It was critical that I got on with her because I’d never played with another girl,” McVie told the Guardian in 2013. “But I liked her instantly. She was funny and nice but also there was no competition. We were completely different on the stage to each other and we wrote differently too.”

Throughout the band’s many personal complications – McVie married and divorced Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie and had an affair with the band’s lighting director, while Nicks had rollercoaster romances with Buckingham and Fleetwood – they were each other’s center.

“To be in a band with another girl who was this amazing musician – (McVie) kind of instantly became my best friend,” Nicks told the New Yorker earlier this year. “Christine was a whole other ballgame. She liked hanging out with the guys. She was just more comfortable with men than I had ever been.”

The two protected each other, Nicks said, in a male-dominated industry: “We made a pact, in the very beginning, that we would never be treated with disrespect by all the male musicians in the community.

“I would say to her, ‘Together, we are a serious force of nature, and it will give us the strength to maneuver the waters that are ahead of us,’” Nicks told the New Yorker.

The band succeeds but McVie and Nicks grow distant

“Rumours” was the band’s greatest success to date when it was released in 1977. But the band’s relationships with each other were deteriorating, save for the one between McVie and Nicks. While the pair were enduring breakups with their significant others, Nicks and McVie spent their time offstage together.

The Guardian asked McVie if she was trying to offset the band’s tumult with her songs on “Rumours,” including the lighthearted “You Make Lovin’ Fun” and optimistic “Don’t Stop.” She said she likely had been.

As multiple members’ drug use intensified, the band’s dynamic grew tense. McVie distanced herself from the group in 1984 amid her bandmates’ addictions, telling the Guardian she was “just sick of it.” Nicks, meanwhile, was becoming dependent on cocaine.

McVie told Rolling Stone that year that she’d grown apart from Nicks: “She seems to have developed her own fantasy world, somehow, which I’m not part of. We don’t socialize much.”

In 1986, Nicks checked into the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction, though she later became addicted to Klonopin, which she said claimed years of her life. She quit the prescription drug in the 1990s.

After recording some solo works, McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac for their 1987 album “Tango in the Night,” and two of her songs on that record – “Little Lies” and “Everywhere” – became major hits. But Nicks departed the band soon after, and the band’s best-known lineup wouldn’t officially reunite until 1997 for “The Dance” tour and subsequent live album.

The reunion was short-lived: After the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, McVie officially quit Fleetwood Mac, citing a fear of flying and exhaustion of life on the road.

McVie returns to Fleetwood Mac – and to Nicks’ side

In the 2010s, after more than a decade of retirement, McVie toyed with returning to performing. She officially rejoined Fleetwood Mac after calling Fleetwood himself and gauging what her return would mean for the group.

“Fortunately Stevie was dying for me to come back, as were the rest of the band,” she told the Arts Desk.

In 2015, a year after she’d rejoined Fleetwood Mac, McVie hit the road with her bandmates. Touring with the group was tiring but fun, the first time they’d performed together in years.

“I’m only here for Stevie,” she told the New Yorker that year.

Nicks concurred: “When we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend she’d been of mine that I had lost and didn’t realize the whole consequences of it till now,” she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.

During that tour, McVie wore a silver chain that Nicks had given her – a “metaphor,” McVie told the New Yorker, “that the chain of the band will never be broken. Not by me, anyways. Not again by me.”

McVie told the Arts Desk in 2016 that she and Nicks were “better friends now than (they) were 16 years ago.”

Touring with Buckingham and Fleetwood could quickly get tumultuous for Nicks, McVie said, due to their shared history. “But with me in there, it gave Stevie the chance to get her breath back and not have this constant thing going on with Lindsey: her sister was back,” she said.

Their mutual praise continued: In 2019, McVie said Nicks was “just unbelievable” onstage: “The more I see her perform on stage the better I think she is. She holds the fort.”

When their 2018-2019 tour ended, though – without Buckingham, who was fired – the band “kind of broke up,” McVie told Rolling Stone earlier this year. She added that she didn’t speak with Nicks as often as she did when they toured together.

As for a reunion, McVie told Rolling Stone that while it wasn’t off the table, she wasn’t feeling “physically up for it.”

“I’m getting a bit long in the teeth here,” she said. “I’m quite happy being at home. I don’t know if I ever want to tour again. It’s bloody hard work.”

Nicks remembers her ‘best friend’ McVie

News of McVie’s death rattled Nicks, who wrote that she had only found out McVie was sick days earlier. She called McVie her “best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.”

On her social media accounts, Nicks shared a handwritten note containing lyrics from the Haim song “Hallelujah,” some of which discusses grief and the loss of a best friend.

“See you on the other side, my love,” Nicks wrote. “Don’t forget me – Always, Stevie.”",0.15130772005772009,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221201104829-01-christine-mcvie-stevie-nicks-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'throughout', 'various

"Will Smith, opening up about Oscars slap, tells Trevor Noah ‘hurt people hurt people’",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/entertainment/will-smith-daily-show/index.html,"CNN —

Will Smith opened up to Trevor Noah about the now-famous slap at the Oscars in March during an appearance that aired Monday night on “The Daily Show.”

While promoting his forthcoming film “Emancipation,” Smith called it “a horrific night” and said he “lost it” when he stormed the stage and slapped presenter Chris Rock.

“And I guess what I would say, you just never know what somebody is going through,” Smith said. “I was going through something that night. Not that that justifies my behavior at all.”

Smith said that what was most painful to him was that his actions made it “hard for other people.”

“And it’s like I understood the idea where they say hurt people hurt people,” he said.

“That was a rage that had been bottled for a really long time,” Smith said.

Noah pointed out how Smith had written in his memoir about growing up being afraid of conflict and the talk show host also noted the negative things that have been said about Smith and his family on the internet.

“It was a lot of things,” Smith said in response. “It was the little boy that watched his father beat up his mother, you know. All of that just bubbled up in that moment.”

Smith said who he was in that moment was “not who I want to be.”

In July Smith addressed the slap and issued a public apology on social media.

'The Phantom of the Opera' extends Broadway run due to demand,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/entertainment/the-phantom-of-the-opera-broadway-longer-extension/index.html,"CNN —

The music of the night will continue for eight weeks longer than expected.

The Broadway musical “The Phantom of the Opera” announced in September that it would be closing in February because of declining ticket sales, but plans have changed.

On Tuesday, the show’s producer, Cameron Mackintosh, announced the show will now run until April 16.

An unexpected bolster in sales, as well as a busy Thanksgiving week, helped the longest-running show in Broadway history earn $2.2 million in sales last week, according to The New York Times.

“What a phenomenal response there has been to the show ending,” Mackintosh told the Times. “We’ve sold out virtually everything that we have on sale.”

The musical will celebrate its 35th anniversary in January.

With music by famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, “Phantom” features a masked music lover who haunts the Paris Opera House.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West reach divorce settlement,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/entertainment/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce/index.html,"CNN —

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have come to a divorce agreement, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells CNN.

Per the agreement, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, Kardashian will receive $200,000 per month in child support from West, who last year legally changed his name to Ye, and share joint custody of their four children.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Kardashian and West for comment.

Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February 2021, citing irreconcilable differences.

The couple was married in a lavish wedding in Italy in 2014.

In March 2022, Kardashian was declared legally single after being granted a request to change her marital status.

In an interview with Vogue earlier this year, the Skims founder explained what led to her high-profile split, saying, that “for so long, I did what made other people happy” and that she decided “I’m going to make myself happy.”

She went on to say that “even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it’s important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy.”

“I’ve chosen myself,” she told the publication. “I think it’s okay to choose you.”

In September, West, who in the latter part of this year has lost multiple business partnerships following a string of antisemitic comments, publicly apologized to Kardashian in an interview with “Good Morning America” for “any stress” he’s caused her.

“This is the mother of my children, and I apologize for any stress that I have caused, even in my frustration because God calls me to be stronger,” West said.",0.26334586466165416,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219153353-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-file-2020.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2022,"['cnn', 'kim kardashian', 'kanye', 'divorce agreement', 'cnn', 'per', 'cnn', 'kardashian', 'child support', 'ye', 'share joint custody', 'cnn', 'kardashian', 'kardashian', 'february', 'irreconcilable differences', 'lavish wedding', 'italy', 'march', 'kardashian', 'marital status', 'vogue', 'skims', 'happy ”', '’ m', 'happy. ”', '’ s', 'happy. ” “', '’ ve', '’ s okay', 'you. ”', 'september', 'multiple business partnerships', 'antisemitic comments', 'kardashian', 'morning america', 'stress ”', '’ s', 'god']","[('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Kim Kardashian', 'PERSON'), ('Kanye', 'PERSON'), ('CNN', 'ORG'), ('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Kardashian', 'ORG'), ('200,000', 'MONEY'), ('West', 'LOC'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('Ye', 'PERSON'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Kardashian', 'ORG'), ('West', 'LOC'), ('Kardashian', 'PERSON'), ('West', 'LOC'), ('February 2021', 'DATE'), ('Italy', 'GPE'), ('2014', 'DATE'), ('March 2022', 'DATE'), ('Kardashian', 'PERSON'), ('Vogue', 'ORG'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('Skims', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('West', 'LOC'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Kardashian', 'PERSON'), ('Good Morning America', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('West', 'ORG')]",Entertainment
Marsai Martin and Omari Hardwick play to win in ‘Fantasy Football’,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/entertainment/marsai-martin-omari-hardwick-fantasy-football/index.html,"CNN —

The new film “Fantasy Football” capitalizes on some of its stars natural talent.

Marsai Martin channels lots of girl-boss energy playing Callie Coleman, a tech-savvy young woman whose father’s long career in the NFL lands him with the Atlanta Falcons team.

Her production company is behind the family-friendly film. (Martin, 18, set a Guinness World Record in 2020 as the youngest Hollywood executive producer to work on a major production.)

She and costars Omari Hardwick (Bobby Coleman), Rome Flynn (Anderson Fisher), along with the film’s director Anton Cropper, recently spoke with CNN when they appeared at a Falcons game held at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.

It was familiar surroundings as the group shot plenty of scenes for their movie there.

The plot centers around Callie’s father, played by Hardwick, seemingly at the end of his career when his daughter discovers she can control his moves via playing the Madden football video game.

Martin sees the role in which her character also makes friends with the robotics club team members at her new school as more than just fun with its positive message about diversity in technology.

“I’ve met so many girls who are in to technology and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) or are all about Black girls coding,” she said. “It’s important to shine a light on it because it’s a very big deal. It’s all about representation.”

For Hardwick, the project gave him the opportunity to lean into his football roots.

Before he became famous for his work in roles like James “Ghost” St. Patrick on “Power,” the Savannah, Georgia native played as a defensive back at the University of Georgia and later tried out with the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent.

“It feels incredible to be right back here at home,” Hardwick said. “This is obviously my hometown team…but I never got to play for the Falcons. With this film, I got to do my thing.”

Hardwick also pointed out that it was appropriate that they were attending a game in which the Atlanta Falcons were playing the Chicago Bears given that Rome Flynn, who plays Bobby Coleman’s rival, the hotshot young quarterback Anderson Fisher, grew up in Chicago.

Flynn told CNN that unlike their characters, he and Hardwick had no competition between them as leading men.

“It’s all love,” he said smiling. “We respect each other and we brought out the best in each other.”

'Wednesday' review: Jenna Ortega makes Netflix's Addams Family series look like a snap,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/entertainment/wednesday-review/index.html,"CNN —

Although the main character’s name was inspired by the poetic line “Wednesday’s child is full of woe,” “Wednesday” is generally a delight, thanks almost entirely to Jenna Ortega. Having outgrown her Disney Channel days, Ortega makes the Addams Family’s now-high-school-age daughter the coolest humorless goth sociopath you’ll ever meet, in a Netflix series that’s more kooky than spooky or ooky.

Director Tim Burton sets just the right visual tone – a mix of the comedic and macabre that resembles “Edward Scissorhands” – while teaming up with “Smallville” producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who know something about building a TV show around an extraordinary teen. Indeed, when Wednesday gets enrolled in a new private school, Nevermore Academy, she tells the headmistress (“Game of Thrones’” Gwendoline Christie) about her frequent moves from school to school, “They haven’t built one strong enough to hold me.”

That might change at Nevermore, a Poe-etic name for this haven for the weird and witchy, with a supernatural vibe that’s as much Hogwarts (or X-Men) as Charles Addams’ signature comic strip.

Not only does Wednesday have to deal with dawning psychic abilities and the strange visions that go with them, but a mystery emerges that turns the suspicious lass into an ill-tempered, ebon-clad Nancy Drew, trying to ascertain who’s responsible as the clues begin to circle back to her own family tree.

It’s obviously a fairly derivative mashup of genre elements, but the mix works in part because even the smaller ingredients are tasty, from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman as Wednesday’s parents, Morticia and Gomez, to her sidekick Thing, who obtains a dress she wants by employing – what else? – a “five-fingered discount.” The writers extract a great deal of comedic mileage from that extremity, so give them a hand.

What separates “Wednesday” from similar efforts (Netflix’s “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” comes to mind), ultimately, is Ortega, who somehow manages to be relentlessly strange, a portrait in unblinking intensity and oddly endearing all at once. When the character description includes never raising one’s voice or cracking even the hint of a smile, that’s no small feat.

Throw in nifty touches like having Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday in the 1990s movies, as part of the school staff, and the local sheriff (Jamie McShane) dismissing Wednesday and her classmates as “the Scooby gang,” and the series operates on multiple levels.

Perhaps inevitably, “Wednesday” can’t sustain its initial kick as the serialized story unfolds over eight episodes, and the ending becomes too chaotic. Then again, that’s hardly a surprise given the nature of source material designed more for little jokes than a big sweeping story.

Seeking to bring something new a property like the Addams Family, which has been done so many times before, isn’t easy without altering its DNA. To its credit, “Wednesday” rises to the challenge and mostly manages to make it look like a snap.

‘Glass Onion’ sharpens the ‘Knives Out’ formula in a polished Netflix sequel,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/entertainment/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-review/index.html,"CNN —

Rising to the challenge of matching its successful predecessor, “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” maintains the razor-sharp formula, with a setup that feels even more conspicuously like an Agatha Christie homage before an extremely clever series of twists kick in. Writer-director Rian Johnson again assembles a solid cast behind Daniel Craig, but it’s his use of language – where nary a word is wasted – that finally gives the sequel its edge.

Netflix opportunistically stepped up to acquire the “Knives Out” franchise and, departing from its usual “Stroke the filmmakers’ egos” approach to theatrical distribution, will actually give the movie a wide one-week-only release before it hits the streaming service in late December. Most people will probably still wait to consume it in the comfort of their homes, but for those who do take the plunge, it certainly plays well with an appreciative audience.

After the family dynamics in “Knives Out,” which gave everyone a motive to kill off the patriarch, Johnson tries his hand in a different setting, with an eccentric billionaire, Miles Bron (Edward Norton), inviting his old posse of pals to a murder-mystery getaway (during Covid, no less) on his secluded Greek isle, where they’ll be tasked with solving his “murder.”

The game, however, takes an unexpected turn, starting with the invitation to Craig’s master detective Benoit Blanc, who remains brilliant and odd in near-equal measure.

As for the eclectic roster of guests/potential killers (and/or victims), they include a fashion designer/social-media loose cannon (Kate Hudson) and her partner (Jessica Henwick), a fitness influencer (Dave Bautista) and his girlfriend/sidekick (Madelyn Cline), a scientist (Leslie Odom Jr.), a politician (Kathryn Hahn), and most intriguingly, Miles’ estranged former business partner (Janelle Monáe).

Although the latest movie obviously lacks the sense of discovery that greeted the original – and even turned Chris Evans’ sweater into a must-have item (Chris Evans not included), Johnson is smart enough to recognize that while this is about reloading, not reinventing, the change in venues can still refresh the formula.

Craig, moreover, is clearly having a ball with this new signature role, trading in his tuxedos and physicality for a more cerebral form of crimefighting, with a Hercule Poirot-like gift for eavesdropping and a Foghorn Leghorn Southern twang.

In one of those “Kneel before Zod!” flexes, Netflix reportedly paid a fortune to acquire these sequels, which is frankly just the kind of deal that threatens to take a fun little movie and screw it up by creating unreasonable expectations.

Happily, “Glass Onion” finds new layers to explore, in a way that makes the prospect of a new “Knives Out Mystery” every few years sound like a perfectly reasonable idea, wherever and however one chooses to consume it.

‘Love Actually’ cast to reunite for 20th anniversary TV special,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/entertainment/love-actually-20th-anniversary-abc-special/index.html,"Editor’s Note: “Tis the Season: The Holidays on Screen” celebrates the most beloved holiday films and television specials. The special airs Sunday, November 27 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.

CNN —

One of the most beloved modern Christmas classics is turning 20 next year, and to mark the occasion, cast members from the landmark 2003 romantic comedy “Love Actually” are reuniting for a TV special to air on ABC next week, the network announced Tuesday.

Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are taking part in the special, along with the film’s writer-director Richard Curtis.

In a promotional clip shared by ABC program “20/20” on Twitter, Diane Sawyer asks the cast to fill in the sentence, “Love actually is…,” to which Grant drolly answers, “Dead!”

According to ABC, the special will look at how the film successfully corralled a diverse ensemble to create a charming and winsome film examining various loving relationships during a frantic month leading up to Christmas in London, England, going on to become a beloved holiday tradition around the world.

The program, which comes a little early, considering the film was released on November 6, 2003, will also look at how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways people interact, love and connect, and the all-important need for kindness in families and communities.

The new reunion is not the first time the actors from “Love Actually” – who also include Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth – have come together again.

In 2017, a short sequel to the film was produced for NBC in honor of Red Nose Day, a charity for children in need created by Curtis.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet almost didn't to star in 'Titanic',https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/entertainment/james-cameron-leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-titanic/index.html,"CNN —

James Cameron is sharing some surprising details from the making of his blockbuster hit “Titanic,” which celebrates 25 years of being released next month.

In a new video interview with GQ, the iconic director revealed that he almost didn’t end up casting Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet – his two romantic leads whose careers as major Hollywood movie stars were cemented by the landmark Oscar-winning film.

While considering actors to play the roles of his star-crossed lovers on the doomed ocean liner, Cameron explained that he was initially thinking of someone like Gwyneth Paltrow for Rose, and that while Winslet had been proposed as an option, he was afraid she was too much of a typecast.

“I actually didn’t see Kate at first,” he said in the video. “She had done a couple of other historical dramas as well, and she was getting a reputation as ‘Corset Kate’ doing historical stuff.” (It is true that “The Reader” actress’s three credits prior to “Titanic” were also period costume dramas – “Sense and Sensibility” in 1995, followed by “Jude” and “Hamlet” one year later.)

Cameron went on to say that he was afraid that putting Winslet in the role “was going to look like the laziest casting in the world,” but that he nonetheless agreed to meet her in the end. Of course, he thought she was “fantastic,” and the rest is history.

With DiCaprio, meanwhile, there were some initial hiccups.

After an initial “hysterical” meeting with the heartthrob actor, in which all the women in the production office somehow ended up in the conference room alongside Cameron, DiCaprio was invited back for a screen test with Winslet, who had already been cast at that point.

But when the “Romeo + Juliet” star came in, he was surprised to learn he’d have to read lines and be filmed alongside Winslet to gauge their chemistry on camera.

“He came in, he thought it was another meeting to meet Kate,” Cameron described.

He remembered telling the pair, “We’ll just run some lines, and I’ll video it.”

But then DiCaprio – who by then had led several movies and scored an Oscar nomination for 1993’s “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” – informed Cameron, “You mean I’m reading?…I don’t read,” meaning that he no longer submitted to having to audition for film roles.

Without missing a beat, Cameron extended his hand to the star and and told him, “Well, thanks for coming by.”

The director then explained to DiCaprio the enormity of the project before them, how the film was going to take two years out of his life, and how he was “not going to f**k it up by making the wrong decision in casting.”

“So you’re going to read or you’re not going to get the part,” Cameron said he told the young actor.

DiCaprio reluctantly submitted, to his credit.

Cameron remembered how the actor “lit up” and “became Jack,” creating electric chemistry with Winslet later seen plainly in the film itself.
